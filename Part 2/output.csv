Denny Smith
Good morning, everyone",1.0
Thank you for joining Nabors' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call,0.9
"Today, we will follow our customary format, with Tony Petrello, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and William Restrepo, our Chief Financial Officer, providing their perspectives on the quarter's results along with insights into our markets and how we expect Nabors to perform in these markets",0.1
"
In support of these remarks, a slide deck is available both as a download within the webcast and in the Investor Relations section of nabors",0.0
com,0.0
Instructions for the replay of this call are posted on the website as well,0.0
"With us today, in addition to Tony, William and myself, are Siggi Meissner, President of our Global Drilling Organization; and other members of the senior management team",0.1
"
Since much of our commentary today will include our forward expectations, they may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934",-0.4
Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as disclosed by Nabors from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,-1.0
"As a result of these factors, our actual results may vary materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements",-0.5
"
Also, during the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as net debt, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow",-0.7
"All references to EBITDA made by either Tony or William during their presentations, whether qualified by the word adjusted or otherwise, mean adjusted EBITDA as that term is defined on our website and in our earnings release",-0.1
"
Likewise, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, reference to cash flow means free cash flow as that non-GAAP measure is defined in our earnings release",0.8
We have posted to the Investor Relations section of our website a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most recently comparable GAAP measures,-0.1
"
Now, I will turn the call over to Tony to begin",0.2
"
Tony Petrello
Good morning",1.0
Thank you for joining us as we review our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019,1.0
Our remarks will follow the usual format,0.0
"I will begin with comments on the market, our results and the outlook",0.0
William will follow with details and I will then wrap up,0.0
Now to the macro,0.3
"During the fourth quarter, the price of near-month WTI averaged just under $57",-0.1
This was essentially flat with the third quarter average,-0.8
"
During the fourth quarter, the trend in pricing was solidly upward",-0.1
The quarter began sub $54 and then did above $61,-0.1
Natural gas prices were essentially flat averaging just over $2,-0.5
40 per Mcf during the fourth quarter,0.0
"In the most recent quarterly Dallas Fed Energy Survey, half of E&amp;P respondent reported using WTI in the $53 to $56 range for the 2020 capital planning",0.3
"Since the beginning of 2020, the price of near month WTI has declined from $61 to $51",0.0
Oil prices are reacting to fears of reduced economic growth and crude oil demand in China and elsewhere,-1.0
"

These fears have been triggered by the recent coronavirus outbreak in China",-1.0
The impact to global oil demand is uncertain,-0.9
The reports estimate consumption in China has declined by as much as 3 million barrels per day,0.0
"At the same time, OPEC has proposed temporary production cut to mitigate the lower demand",0.0
"As I anticipated on our prior earnings call, industrywide drilling activity in the Lower 48 declined through the end of the year",-0.1
"
This reduction resulted from the combination of limited access to capital as well as investor pressure to generate free cash flow",0.4
"During the fourth quarter, the average US Lower 48 land industry rig count declined by 97 rigs, and a 11% reduction from the third quarter average",-1.0
I will have some more thoughts on this when I cover our quarterly customer surveys in a few minutes,0.0
"
For our international markets, the macro picture remains positive",0.9
"Pricing is improving, activity is increasing",0.8
"In most markets, the level of oil prices has continued to support incremental activity even after the recent softening",0.8
The typical international customer in NOC or IOC is increasingly committed to longer-term development plans,0.0
"
As such, we expect improving conditions across most of our markets to drive incremental rig demand",-0.6
"Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $203 million solidly in line with our expectations held up well, despite the reductions in the US activity",0.8
"Sequentially, our Canada Drilling Solutions, US offshore and international operations, all recorded improvement",0.7
Our Lower 48 average rig count declined by ten rigs,-1.0
Daily gross margin was essentially flat as somewhat higher average revenue per day was offset by a similar increase in daily operational expenses,-0.2
"In our International segment, adjusted EBITDA increased by about 1% despite a significant reduction in amortizing revenue following recent contract renewal",0.0
"
This improvement reflects better operating performance across several markets",1.0
"In other segment, Drilling Solutions improved sequentially even as market conditions deteriorated",-1.0
This marks three quarters of sequential improvement in NDS,0.7
Canada results increased with the seasonal lift in drilling activity,0.0
"
Rig Technologies declined as sales of capital equipment tailed off into the end of the year",-0.5
"Now, let me discuss our view of the market in more detail",0.2
"During the fourth quarter, the industry rig count in the Lower 48 averaged 790 rigs",-1.0
"Last week, the rig count stood at 757, that is down by 17 rigs from the end of the fourth quarter, which stood at 774, a 2% reduction",-1.0
"Over the past 12 months, the rig counts declined by 259 rigs or 26%",-1.0
"
For the full year 2019, Nabors' Lower 48 rig count outperformed the industry",-1.0
Our full year average rig count improved by 1% as the industry rig count dropped by 9%,-0.5
Our largest peers also experienced significant drops on rig count,-1.0
This performance validates our positioning in the market,0.1
"We believe we offer the best combination of rigs, technology, safety and operational excellence",1.0
"
During the fourth quarter, a steep drop in natural gas prices had a dramatic impact on rig counts and pricing in predominantly gas basins",-1.0
"Activity dropped sharply in the Rockies, Haynesville, Mid-Continent and Marcellus",-0.4
"Rather than chasing lower pricing, we decided to stack some of our legacy rigs and move high-spec rigs to other market",-1.0
"Once again, we surveyed our top 20 Lower 48 customers",0.0
The surveyed clients account for approximately 41% of the total Lower 48 industry rig count at year-end and 71% of Nabors' rig count,-1.0
"
On balance, the participants indicated a flat outlook for 2020",0.0
"I would remind you that these conclusions are those of this customer group, which may not be representative of the full market",-0.1
"As I mentioned earlier, our Lower 48 rig count has held up quite well in spite of current industry conditions",-1.0
"At this point, our working fleet in the Lower 48 is overwhelmingly high-spec",-0.1
These rigs comprise 98% of our working rig count,-1.0
"Looking at it another way, rigs working in the predominantly oil basins, Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken, comprise about 87% of our count",-0.9
The market for high-spec rigs in the oily plays comprises the strongest segment of the Lower 48,-0.9
"

Our solid presence there and strong customer mix explain our high utilization and resilient financial results",0.7
"Across the industry, high spec rig pricing has moderated somewhat",-1.0
Contractors have begun adjusting to the recent market trends and the significant pricing disparities between basins,0.0
"
This trend varies a great deal depending on the market",1.0
We continue to hold the line on pricing,0.0
"With our focus on the delivery of value and performance to our customers, we are confident we will retain our leadership position",1.0
"In our International markets, industry rig activity was stable in 2019",0.8
Pricing in these markets is firm with pockets of strength,0.8
We have already deployed additional rigs not present in our fourth quarter rig count and should deploy at least one more as we head into the second quarter,-1.0
"
We continue to pursue multiple opportunities for additional high-spec rigs in several markets",-0.8
"In the other segments, we see growing interest in our advanced technologies and Drilling Solutions",0.6
The adoption of our innovative products and services continues to increase and inquiry levels remain high,0.0
"Now, let me comment in more detail on our segment highlights",0.2
"
Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $805 million was up 6% versus the prior year",-0.1
"For the fourth quarter, EBITDA of $203 million as we expected was just below the prior quarter",-0.1
"Among our segments, we saw the strongest sequential adjusted EBITDA growth in Canada",0.8
Our rig count there grew by almost five rigs or 60% as seasonal demand improved,0.7
"
Drilling Solutions adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially by 6% to $24",0.0
8 million,0.0
This improvement primarily reflects higher margins than tubular running services,0.6
International adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million to $96,0.0
2 million,0.0
"Improvements in Latin America and the Middle East, drove the growth",1.0
These improvements more than offset a reduction in amortizing revenue of approximately $10 million following the expiration and subsequent renewal of number of contracts with material upfront payment,0.2
"
Adjusted EBITDA in US drilling declined by $8 million or 6%",-0.1
This was mainly due to the 10% reduction in quarterly average rig count in the Lower 48,-1.0
"In Rig Technologies, segment results declined due to lower shipments in Canrig",-1.0
We achieved some notable highlights during the quarter,0.7
"First, we took significant steps to improve our debt profile",-0.7
"In December, we amended the revolver and now have covenants more to think with our business",0.1
"More recently, we raised $1 billion at attractive terms and subsequently tendered for existing notes",0.5
"
With these transactions, we substantially extended our debt maturities",-1.0
"Second, I want to mention the performance of Nabors Drilling Solutions",0.1
"Certainly, competitors have adopted similar models to compete with our NDS strategy",0.0
"I believe, we remain the industry leader integrating additional services onto our rigs and in driving the automation of the drilling process",-0.8
"
This is demonstrated by the level of profits delivered by our NDS segment and by its continued growth trend",0.9
Our TRS value proposition is gaining share with increased profitability as we pursue our integration strategy,0.5
We have a robust set of fit for purpose downhole technologies that are still in the early stage of harvesting,1.0
"And, NDS today has the most extensive and mature performance software suite in the industry",0.3
"
ROCKit, the industry's gold standard for oscillation systems to reduce friction and increased ROP saw its share increase driven by third-party jobs",0.0
This asset light segment outperformed both Nabors and the industry's Lower 48 rig count,-0.9
"Segment EBITDA increased, thanks to continued margin improvement in casing running",1.0
"Penetration of software solutions, notably, Pilot and Navigator also increased",0.0
"

In a declining fourth quarter rig market, we maintained our total Pilot Navigator job count",-1.0
"Third, our daily gross margin in the Lower 48 business was essentially unchanged sequentially in the fourth quarter even as the market deteriorated",-1.0
"For the full year, daily margin in the Lower 48 exceeded $10,000 in each quarter and was up more than $2,000 versus 2018",-0.4
"
We continue to maintain pricing discipline, and to realize the value we deliver to customers",0.5
Now let me discuss our outlook by segment,0.3
"US drilling; in US drilling, for the first quarter, we believe our Lower 48 rig count should approximate the current level of activity, or slightly higher",-1.0
We expect the Lower 48 daily margins to decline by a few hundred dollars per day,-0.1
Our Alaska activity and results should improve,1.0
"
The US offshore business should be essentially in line with the fourth quarter",0.0
"International; in the International segment, we expect rig activity to increase by a couple of rigs",-1.0
"We recently deployed two offshore platform rigs in Mexico; one in late December, and one in January",-0.2
We also placed a large rig works in Kuwait and our Russia rigs will resume activity during the quarter,-1.0
"
We expect some incremental downtime in key markets to work on certification and planned maintenance activities",0.1
"All in, we expect first quarter international adjusted EBITDA of $90 million to $95 million",0.0
"Drilling Solutions; in Drilling Solutions, we expect first quarter results somewhat below the fourth quarter",0.1
"The decline in third-party rig count in the US, quarter-over-quarter, and churn of the business is driving most of the expected decline",-1.0
"For the remainder of the year, we expect continued adjusted EBITDA growth, as we harvest the technology portfolio",0.9
"
Rig Technologies; for Rig Technologies, we expect an improvement in adjusted EBITDA as the shipments of equipment in part as well as the volume of services pick up",0.7
"Annual outlook; for the full year, we are targeting the following",0.0
"First, we expect to extract increasing value from our existing asset base",0.8
This includes the deployment of idle assets and repositioning assets to higher value market,0.0
"
Second, our plan is to accelerate the monetization of our robust technology platform",0.9
We are on target to commercialize several impactful projects and expect them to generate revenue during 2020,0.0
"In addition, the trajectory for our Navigator and Pilot performance tools is steep and we expect them to contribute materially to the segment's revenue and earnings",0.2
"
Third, we target free cash flow generation of $300 million in 2020",0.8
"During 2020, we expect increased adjusted EBITDA, lower amortizing revenue, reduced capital expenditures and working capital reduction",-0.1
That concludes my remarks on the fourth quarter results and our outlook,0.0
"
At this point, I usually turn the call over to William for his discussion of the financial results",-0.1
"Before I do that, I would like to make a few remarks about a member of our team",1.0
"After 102 quarterly earnings seasons at Nabors, just part of a full career Denny Smith has announced his plan to retire in April",0.0
Denny joined Nabors in 1992,0.0
"During his tenure, his contributions have been invaluable to Nabors' operational, financial and corporate development success",0.7
Denny's career in the oilfield spans more than 40 years,0.0
"
In the early part of his oilfield tenure, he played a pivotal role in the development of the North Slope of Alaska",0.2
"While at Nabors, his responsibilities span to Alaska, the international arena and many significant projects",0.1
"You may not realize this, but most recently, Denny was the chief architect and negotiated for the SANAD joint venture in Saudi Arabia",0.1
"
For me personally, I consider him an industry oracle",0.0
Denny is well known to many of you on this call,0.9
He is widely considered the dean of Investor Relations in the OFS space,0.0
"I hope you all appreciate it as I have, his wisdom, his candor and his honestly",1.0
He has mentored innumerable successful professionals within Nabors and in the broader industry,0.1
"

Bill Conroy will be assuming the senior role in IR and Corporate Development and has big shoes to fill",0.1
Please join me in wishing Denny and Lunet many happy years in a well-earned retirement,1.0
You will be remembered and sorely missed,-1.0
"Now, I will turn over the call to William",0.1
"After his comments, I will follow with some closing remarks",0.0
"
William Restrepo
Good morning",1.0
The net loss from continuing operations attributable to Nabors of $267 million in the fourth quarter represented a loss of $0,-1.0
77 per share,0.0
"
Results from the quarter included $186 million or $0",0.0
"53 per share, in impairments and other charges",0.0
"These charges were primarily related to impairments of goodwill and other assets as well as the writedowns of receivables, reflecting increased political risk and the shutdown of certain countries",-1.0
"
The fourth quarter results compared to a loss of $123 million or $0",-0.6
37 per share in the prior quarter,0.0
Results in the third quarter included $23,0.0
2 million or $0,0.0
"06 per share, in exceptional charges related to an income tax settlement in a foreign jurisdiction and after-tax currency losses",-0.6
"
Revenue from operations for the fourth quarter was $714 million, a sequential reduction of $44 million or 5",0.0
8%,0.1
US drilling fell by $18,-0.1
3 million or 5,0.0
9% driven primarily by reduced rig count in the Lower 48,-1.0
Rig Technologies revenue decreased by $10,-0.1
5 million reflecting reductions in equipment and parts sales,0.0
Our average rig count in the Lower 48 of 97,-1.0
5 declined by just over ten rigs,-0.9
Some 1,0.1
5 rigs more than we had anticipated,0.5
"Daily rig revenue in the Lower 48 at 26,455 increased by slightly more than $500",-0.6
"
I would like to clarify that our drilling revenue per day includes only revenue strictly related to our drilling rig services business, plus certain reimbursable items rebuild to our customers",-0.8
"It does not include any of our performance software, sometimes called App, it does not include drilling automation revenue and it does not include revenue related to casing running, managed pressure drilling, and BOP testing",-0.6
All of these are included in the results of our Nabors Drilling Solutions segment,0.0
"
International drilling revenue at $332 million increased by $3",0.0
4 million primarily due to improved operational performance across several market,0.5
This improvement offset a roughly $10 million reduction in amortization of deferred revenue from advanced payments,0.2
The reduction reflects a significant number of contracts that recently concluded and were subsequently renewed by our customers,0.3
"
Canada drilling revenue at $19",0.0
4 million increased by $7,0.0
2 million,0.0
This was driven by the usual seasonal ramp-up in activity going from an average of 7,-0.1
7 rigs working in the third quarter to 12,-0.2
3 rigs in the fourth quarter,-0.1
Drilling Solutions revenue of $60,0.0
5 million declined by $1,-0.1
8 million from the previous quarter,-0.1
"
Our international activity increases were more than offset by lower rig count in the US land market",-1.0
Revenue in our Rig Technologies segment was $10,-1.0
5 million lower at $52,0.0
6 million,0.0
"The decreased revenue came primarily from lower internal sales of capital equipment, as well as falling spare parts and repairs revenue, driven by the lower US rig count",-1.0
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $203 million compared to $207 million in the third quarter,-0.1
"
As we expected, a reduction in Lower 48 and Canrig activity was largely compensated by improved results in our other segments",-0.7
US Drilling adjusted EBITDA of $113,0.0
1 million was down by 6% sequentially,-0.3
"In the Lower 48, daily margins held steady closing at $10,218",0.0
"Again, I would like to point out that these margins are pure drilling rig margins without contribution from software, app, trucking between locations, casing running or other sources of revenue sometimes included in the margins of our competitors",-0.5
"

We expect daily rig margin to tail off somewhat toward the $10,000 mark in the first quarter driven by market price erosion in certain regions",-1.0
Our current rig count is 90 in the Lower 48,-1.0
Rig count for the quarter should average slightly higher than the current level,-0.1
International adjusted EBITDA increased by almost $1 million to $96,0.0
2 million in the fourth quarter,0.0
"
Despite a 0",0.0
6 rig reduction to 87,-0.7
1 average rig,-1.0
"Incremental revenue days in Mexico and Kazakhstan were more than offset by idle time between contracts in Russia, as we moved our operating rigs to a new customer",-0.6
"Nonetheless, our operational uptime in the Middle East was substantially better than the prior quarter and we continue to reduce cost in Latin America",1.0
"
These operational and cost improvements more than offset the roughly $10 million sequential reduction in amortizing revenue and the slightly lower rig count",-0.5
"International daily gross margin increased from approximately $13,700 to $14,100, bolstered by the improvements in cost and uptime performance",0.2
We currently expect International Q1 adjusted EBITDA to dip somewhat in the first quarter,0.0
We are conducting certification projects in several rigs in the Middle East which will likely result in significant planned downtime,-0.2
"
This will be partly offset by start-ups in Mexico and Kuwait as well as increased activity in Russia",0.0
"Canada, adjusted EBITDA increased by $3",0.0
8 million to $5,0.0
3 million,0.0
The rig count at 12,-0.9
3 was 4,-0.1
"6 higher and daily margin increased from $3,800 to $5,500",0.0
This increase is somewhat better than what we had predicted,1.0
"Going into Q1, we expect to continue with additional improvements in rig count and margins",-0.9
The Canadian market continues to surprise to the upside,0.3
"
Drilling Solutions posted adjusted EBITDA of $24",0.0
"8 million, up from $23",0.0
5 million in the third quarter,0.0
The adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment increased to 41% from 37,0.0
7%,0.0
"Among product lines, the largest improvement was in tubular running services as our activity continue to shift toward higher margin integrated services",0.7
"Our other NDS product lines declined modestly in the fourth quarter, driven by the lower US rig count",-1.0
"For the first quarter, we are expecting a reduction in adjusted EBITDA as the Lower 48 drilling activity continues to fall",-0.1
Rig Technologies reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1,-0.4
"6 million in the fourth quarter, $3",0.0
7 million below third quarter results,0.0
"
We are expecting some improvement in adjusted EBITDA in Q1 to just above breakeven",0.7
"For Nabors as a whole, for the first quarter, we would expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of $193 million to $200 million",-0.1
"Now, let me review our liquidity and cash generation",0.4
We remain busy during 2019 addressing liquidity and leverage,0.0
"As last year started, we promised our investors that we would reduce our net debt between $200 million and $250 million",-0.9
"
Although the market in the US was not quite what we expected, we reduced net debt by $220 million and closed the year with just under $2",-1.0
9 billion in net debt,-0.9
"To achieve our goal, we implemented further cuts to our overhead and capital expenditures and we reduced our DSO significantly",0.5
"In December, we amended our existing 2018 revolving credit facility",0.0
"Most significantly, this amendment replaced the previous net debt to capitalization covenant with a more suitable covenant to maintain net funded debt at less than 5",-0.9
5 times EBITDA,0.0
"
We also addressed nearly $1 billion of our near-term debt maturities",-0.9
"In early January, Nabors completed an offering at attractive rate of $600 million of senior notes due in 2026 and another $400 million due in 2028",0.3
The proceeds from this offering were used to successfully tender for more than $950 million of senior notes maturing in 2021 and 2023,0.2
"
In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $232 million",0.9
This compares to approximately $82 million in the prior quarter,-0.1
Our cash generation in the quarter was strong in part due to seasonally low interest payments,-0.5
"In addition, we reduced our capital expenses, and benefited from strong collections",0.6
I would point out that almost all of our interest payments come in the first and third quarters,0.1
"The first quarter cash generation will reflect the interest payments, higher capex, property taxes disbursements for bonuses and other one-time costs associated with the beginning of the year",-0.1
"

Capital expenditures of $60",0.1
"6 million in the fourth quarter, fell by $26",-0.6
5 million below the level of the preceding quarter,0.0
"Capex for the full year was $424 million, somewhat higher than our target as we brought forward committed upgrades and certification from contract renewals in Argentina",-0.3
We are now targeting $350 million to $370 million in capex for 2020,0.0
"In 2020, we remained focused on generating cash flow while decreasing our leverage",0.0
We are targeting free cash flow of $300 million in 2020,0.9
"We believe this target is achievable as we will reduce our capex significantly, as compared to 2019, and in addition, our amortizing revenue is expected to decrease by $45 million versus 2019",0.3
"
These tailwinds should more than offset any potential increases in working capital",0.3
I would also like to thank Denny for his tireless efforts to help us improve Nabors,1.0
Denny is one of the best people I know,1.0
"During my time in Nabors, he has been a teacher and mentor, a source of advice, and most importantly, a friend",0.6
"
I will greatly miss his wisdom, his sense of humor and his support",1.0
"With that, I will turn the call back to Tony for his concluding remarks",-0.1
"
Tony Petrello
Thank you, William",1.0
I will now conclude my remarks this morning with the following,-0.1
I would like to say that I'm very proud of what our team accomplished during 2019 in a tough industry environment,0.9
"First, during the past several years, we have transformed our fleet in Lower 48 from predominantly legacy assets to what we believe is the most capable, modern fleet in the market",0.8
"
Our customer base recognizes the quality of our assets, the competency of our crews, our industry-leading operational performance and the value-added for our performance software and our services integration",0.1
"And, they have rewarded us with increased market share and premium pricing",1.0
We believe our utilization of high-spec rigs is the highest of our peers,-0.4
"
This has helped us outperform our competitors in this important market",1.0
We were the only major land contractor to grow average Lower 48 rig count in 2019,-1.0
"Second, our Nabors Drilling Solutions segment has continued to grow despite the steep drop in Lower 48 rig count",-0.9
"Year-on-year, adjusted EBITDA growth was 34%",0.7
"
Our drilling automation software offerings have made significant strides",0.1
"The high, margin-low capital intensity software business accounts for a significant portion of our NDS adjusted EBITDA",0.0
It contributes strongly to our cash flow,0.0
"You may find the depth and breadth of our downhole tool portfolio surprising, and it will continue to grow",0.7
"When we started NDS, we used our rigs to pull through incremental NDS activity",-0.8
"Today, our innovative NDS offerings are also helping us to improve our drilling rig market share",0.9
"
Third, our balanced global presence and diversified offerings have provided us with stability in our results",0.9
"As our competitors dropped off in the third and fourth quarters, Nabors continued to grow in the third quarter and sustained those levels in the final quarter of the year",-0.1
"
Our leading offshore rig position provides a meaningful contribution to our results",0.7
Our International NDS in Canada teams have offset the market weakness in the US,-1.0
"In short, we have a diversified set of quality market position, each of which has strong growth drivers",0.8
This combination is unique in the space,0.6
"
Finally, the hard work on our leverage and liquidity has started to show results",-0.9
Amendment to our credit facility in December removed the investor concerns about covenants,-0.1
"In January, we demonstrated our ability to tap capital markets with $1 billion in six- and eight-year notes at attractive rate",0.2
This was followed by the redemption of nearly $1 billion of senior notes with relatively nearer term maturities,-0.3
"
As a result, we increased our average debt duration to 4",-1.0
7 years and substantially alleviated the liquidity concerns of our investors,-0.2
"At the same time, we reduced our leverage",0.0
net debt decreased by $220 million in 2019,-0.7
"These improvements resulted from increased adjusted EBITDA over the prior year, as well as lower capex, interest expenses, and dividend",0.7
"

Looking forward, I'm excited with what the future has in store for Nabors",1.0
Our rig and services portfolio is stronger than ever,1.0
"We have made enormous progress in our strategy of fleet modernization, international strength, integration of drilling services into the rig, and automation of the drilling rig and the drilling process",-0.5
"
Several of our technologies already contribute meaningfully to our results",0.3
We are now commercializing a number of our automation initiatives,0.1
"In addition to continued penetration from our NDS mainstays, we expect our drilling automation software to start moving the needle in 2020",0.1
"And, with initial deployments in automated rig floors offshore and automated pipe handling on land, we still have gains ahead of us from the robotization of the rig",-0.7
"
That concludes my remarks this morning",0.0

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session",0.0
[Operator Instructions],0.0
And our first question comes from Waqar Syed of AltaCorp Capital,0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Waqar Syed
Thank you for taking my call",1.0
"First of all, Denny, I want to join Tony and William in thanking you for your service to the industry and to your friendship for over the last 20 years",1.0
"You've really enlightened me, I've learned a lot from you, and I believe that a generation of sell-side analysts have learned from you about the industry",1.0
So thank you again,1.0
"Thank you for your service, and congratulations on your retirement, I hope you're able to take some rest now",1.0
Thank you,1.0
"
Denny Smith
Thank you, Waqar",1.0
"
Waqar Syed
My question, first of all, Tony, just a clarification, you mentioned that in your rig survey, your customers, half of them said that maybe activity could be flattish",-1.0
"Is it flattish to -- from current levels, is that what you said",0.0
"
Tony Petrello
From current levels, yes",0.0
"
Waqar Syed
Okay",0.1
I just wanted to clarify that,0.0
"Secondly, on the capex for 2020",0.0
"Could you provide some breakdown on how that would shake out between maintenance and growth and maybe the -- domestic versus international, and also what would be the -- how much of that would be within SANAD",0.6
"
Tony Petrello
Sure",0.1
"I think about -- roughly about $250 million or so range would be sustaining and the rest growth, and I'd say of the growth capital, most of it would be international, some in NDS and some in Rig Tech",-0.6
It does not assume a lot for SANAD,0.0
I'll let William speak to that,0.1
"
William Restrepo
Well, of the $250 million that Tony mentioned, really the sustaining capex, which is really ongoing is about $200 million and there is another $40 million or so that comes from renewals of international contracts which vary from year to year, how many of those renewals we have",0.3
But we are forecasting about $40 million for next year,0.0
"And SANAD -- it does have a big piece, which is a facility and which is about $40 million",0.0
"But outside that, we're still not deploying any of the new builds in Saudi Arabia",-0.3
So the levels there are not much higher than elsewhere,-0.2
"
Waqar Syed
And when do you expect to start investing into the new builds",0.1
"
William Restrepo
Well, it all depends on when NOV is ready, I mean we haven't really gotten a good fix on that, but I don't -- wouldn't expect to start investing in 2020 and no deployments be for the end of 2021, I don't believe at this point",0.7
"
Waqar Syed
Okay",0.1
"And then just one last question, what is the -- what was the cash in the balance sheet of SANAD at the end of the quarter",0.0
"
William Restrepo
It's somewhere around $270 million, $280 million somewhere in that range",0.0
"
Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Voie of Wells Fargo",0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Chris Voie
Good morning",1.0
Thanks,1.0
"I just wanted to check, I think the commentary on NDS was that it should be a little bit lower in the first quarter",-0.1
Curious if you could give a little more color on that,0.0
"And then, at what point do you expect it to recover to 4Q level",0.0
"

Tony Petrello
Sure",0.1
"Well, about a third of NDS is -- it's focused on third-party rigs and therefore given what's happened with rig count, although we think the offering is gaining traction in the broader market, there is some churn going on and therefore it's going to, it will affect our growth in the -- in the first quarter",-1.0
"But for the year, we do believe we're going to keep going",0.0
I think there's a couple of bright spots here,0.0
"The first one is, the casing running portion of NDS, I think you probably not realized it at this point, but TRS has gained market share in both the Gulf of Mexico and it is now the second biggest international tubular operation going on and we have a strong emphasis on execution and I think our margins are actually best in class when measured against the public people available",0.2
"
So that's really been a good story",1.0
"As you know, back about a year ago, we had a pause on this because we were waiting to improve our value proposition with integration",0.9
We now have it,0.3
"We're moving more and more of our jobs to the integrated approach away from conventional and that's accounting for some of the margin gain you're seeing, even on the same job count, it's increasing margin",1.0
"So we think that story is going to continue, because the value of proposition with the customers is compelling",0.5
"On directional drilling, there the story is also kind of interesting, if you think about the marketplace in general, we actually believe that if you think about the drilling -- directional drilling services, I think it's in a -- in a seismic shift arena right now",0.2
"I think four or five years now, it's tough to look at anything like it is today",-1.0
I think what's going to happen is the use of what they should combined which is downhole -- who's going to -- sorry for the interruption,-1.0
"The use of the automation combined with the downhole, I think is making a different value proposition available to the operator",0.0
"
I think also that the historical stronghold that the big four had on directional drilling, both in the US and international is being challenged",0.0
"If you look at the US, for example, the Big four used to count maybe five years ago for 50% of the Lower 48 MWD market, now it's a -- It's down more than half of that number today",0.0
"And so, I think the kind of offering that we now have in place is an offering that has substantial growth opportunity",1.0
"So with all that, I think looking forward throughout the year, I think we're looking at fourth quarter to fourth quarter -- Q4 2019 versus Q4 2020 growth of about 20% or so",0.1
"
William Restrepo
In the 20%s
Tony Petrello
In the 20%s",0.0
"
Chris Voie
Okay, that's helpful",0.8
Thank you,1.0
And then my follow-up,0.0
"So granted your customer base is suggesting that the rig count might be flattish going forward, you guys have some of the best rigs",0.9
Do you expect market share gains and therefore some kind of upward momentum for the second quarter for the US land rig count,0.6
"
I'm just curious to what extent you have any visibility or your thoughts around that",0.0
"
Tony Petrello
I think what we're saying is, I guess right now in terms of this quarter we'll be about the current level or slightly higher, we do anticipate as we go through the year, our rig count will be higher",-1.0
We do expect that,0.0
Margin improvement will depend of course on the trajectory of any such path,0.1
"
But yes, we do expect that there will be an increase",0.0
"Just for your information today, when you look at our fleet in terms of basins, there is a wide disparity between oily basins and gas basins",-1.0
"In North Dakota, just to give you an idea, all 25 of our high-spec rigs are busy 100% utilization",-0.1
"In South Texas, 18 -- 17 of 18 rigs are busy",-0.3
Only -- we only have one of the rig stacked,-1.0
"And in West Texas of our rigs here, we only have one of our ex-rig stacked",-1.0
So that gives you an idea of the high utilization that we're enjoying,1.0
So we think we do have the premier rigs in the marketplace and we think the rigs that are stacked are going to find homes,-0.5
"

William Restrepo
So, I'll make a comment on that also",0.0
"I think part of what we're trying to do is to balance pricing against market share and in the gas basins, we have decided not to chase market share at any cost and preferred to start moving some equipment to other locations and even stacking some rigs",-0.5
"And by the way, we've also stacked, a lot of our legacy rigs",-0.7
Those are the ones that have suffered the brunt of our rig count drop,-1.0
The bigger companies should be stewards of pricing and we're trying to behave responsibly by trying to optimize how much of EBITDA we can squeeze out of the fleet rather than focusing on purely market share,-0.2
"
Operator
Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC",0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Kurt Hallead
Well, good morning",1.0
"Denny, going to miss you, Denn",0.9
I wish you all the best,1.0
You've been a great partner for all this time,1.0
"So really, really appreciate everything you've done",1.0
Thank you,1.0
"
Denny Smith
Thank you",1.0
"
Kurt Hallead
Tony, I got a question for you",0.1
"We're now going on, I guess the fourth year since that great presentation you guys did back in the fall of '16 and kind of outlined this movement toward rig automation and these directional drilling services and the software and apps and so on and maybe if you take a moment to kind of reflect upon the game plan that was laid out back in '16 and kind of where we stand now",0.5
"You called out -- some of the, some of the things that have gone better than you thought, you might have expected and what maybe been some of the speed bumps along the way",0.9
"
Tony Petrello
Sure",0.1
I appreciate the question,0.9
"If you go back and at the time in 2016, I think what we've talked about was something without being talked about in the marketplace",0.0
"I think first of all, it was at that Analyst Day that we actually spoke about the pad-optimal rig, and talked about the special features, the X-rig as well as the new rigs that we are planning in the pipeline",-1.0
"If you remember, the debate back then, we were discussing the view that there was a difference between the walking rig and a skid rig and other people were saying there was no different et cetera, and people are got caught up in that",-1.0
"But you also know that -- at that conference, we identified what everyone now is calling super-spec when we outlined the pad-optimal rig in terms of all the functionality",-1.0
"
At the same conference, we said, and it turned out to be -- I guess, warrants that we said, the industry needs a different model to adjust to growing in a market that's going sideways or potentially down and that's why we create the NDS strategy, and the NDS strategy was focused on not bundling services, but integrating them into the rig and that gave rise to or getting into the casing business as well as the directional business and the software business",-0.3
"
All three of those, I think today advances at -- what at -- that was a pretty precipitous move on our part, it's worked out reasonably well",1.0
"I think I'll be disappointed in the progress of the penetration to be honest with you, a lot of operators during the course of the past three or four years they didn't quite understand what we're talking about, our marketing was probably -- if there was one thing that we didn't spend enough time on, it was marketing, the actual solutions",-1.0
"
But now, I would say everyone's highly engaged and of course the fact is, other people have joined in this effort",0.1
"You have all the other large drilling contractors trying to replicate this to some extent, so in some sense, imitation support of a form of flattery",-0.6
"And I think it's all make sure that it is topical, this is where the action is",0.1
"And I strongly believe that if you look back, the past five years of EBITDA per rig and versus the productivity that the operators got, they obviously got the lion's share of that",-1.0
"

And unless you do something like this, you're going to be challenged",0.0
So for us it's absolutely business necessity to pursue it,-0.1
"And right now, I'm pretty proud of the portfolio we have obviously were much shorter of the objectives that we laid out back then, I didn't envision, we'd have another two downturns in the past four years, and so we've accomplished this with all -- with downturns in our faces as well",0.9
"
And as I said on the call here, I think the best is yet to come, I think the robotization of rigs is going to be a new era, and I think we have some stuff in the pipeline, pretty exciting, as well as some more digital offerings in the pipeline as well",1.0
"
So we're not stopping, we're pretty enthused by the reaction and hopefully we'll find operators that are willing to join in the effort to make this thing work",0.9
"To make this work, it's going to require the industry to change its mindset",-0.1
"We'll need more alliance kind of relationships where there's joint investment in these initiatives because the complications of making them successful really require you to alter your workflows, which requires more stickiness between who you choose to work with",-0.5
"And hopefully some of these larger operators will understand that because the untapped potential for them is fantastic, as well as the benefit from the drilling contractor",1.0
So that's the way we see it,0.0
"
William Restrepo
And Kurt, I'll comment on the financial part of it",0.1
"I think we're very, very happy with the results, up to now",1.0
We are very encouraged by what we're seeing today,0.7
"About 12% of our EBITDA is coming from Nabors Drilling Solutions, right",0.4
And we wanted to drive that number to 20% of our total results,0.0
"
And I'll tell you why, because we mentioned the margins at 41%, those are the highest margins we have in our whole portfolio and, but the second thing even more importantly of the $100 million or so that we expect or we had last year about $25 million was the capex, right, so the conversion of that EBITDA into cash flow is huge as compared to a drilling rig business and the margins are much higher",0.0
"So we think as we move forward into a more NDS world, we are changing the nature of our cash generation and you're seeing it in the results of 2019, and what we expect to see in 2020",0.2
"
Kurt Hallead
That's great summary",1.0
"And then maybe for you William on a follow-up, the $300 million of free cash flow target for 2020 I was wondering if you give us some insights as to what kind of net -- what kind of working capital contribution you expect to help drive -- drive that free cash flow",1.0
"
William Restrepo
So, so I did say at least, right, I didn't say it $300 million, but, yeah, the working capital is helping us, but it's helping us just to stay in place in the sense that we expect to reduce our DSO by about five days during this coming year, which will offset most of the increase in revenue that we expect to see in 2020",1.0
"So from the working capital, you're not seeing, what you're seeing -- the biggest increases really are from the reduction in capex, which is quite significant, and the second one is the $45 million or so",-0.8
So we expect to have higher EBITDA in 2020 than in 2019,0.0
"And of that, higher EBITDA, $45 million reduction in amortizing revenue, so that just goes straight down to the -- to the free cash flow",0.9
"
So those two numbers are pretty significant, if you add them up",0.2
"
Kurt Hallead
Okay",-0.3
"And then the goal, is it what, reduce debt by that amount of free cash flow",-0.8
"
Tony Petrello
Well, we have some dividends to take account of, so not quite that amount, but I did say at least $300 million",-0.2
"So…
Operator
Our next question comes from Jon Hunter of Cowen",-0.1
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Jonathan Hunter
Hey, good morning and Denny, congratulations",1.0
"
Denny Smith
Thank you",1.0
"
Jonathan Hunter

So first one I wanted to ask is just on the Lower 48",0.0
So you all did a great job outperforming the market in 2019,1.0
Your guidance for the first quarter implies a decline a little bit below market and it appears that these drops are mostly from private operators,-0.1
"So I'm wondering how you see things playing out as we move into the second and the third quarter, and if you have visibility to picking up some of that activity that was lost from some of the privates",-1.0
"
William Restrepo
The 2020 is still little premature for visibility",-0.4
"I would say in our core market, we're comfortable with the level and we also have some green shoots to pick up some rigs",0.9
"So away from -- and that core market that's just the super majors with the large independents, and that's 65% of our count",-0.1
"But yes, you're right, there is some focus now on the other segment, and we're going to probably be redoing our efforts there to attack that as well",-0.9
One thing that we struggled with a little bit is how much of the impact of the health crisis in China is going to impact oil prices,-1.0
"So a lot of our guidance, you have to take it with that in mind",0.1
We thought it would be appropriate to put a little bit wider range in our expectations for the first quarter and that widening was to the downside,-0.9
"Absent that health crisis, I think we would have been more aggressive in our forecast",-1.0
"It's really, it's very difficult at this point to see what the impact of that crisis will be on our results",-1.0
"We do think that, I do think however that I would expect us to land closer to the upper end of the range than to the lower",0.0
"
Tony Petrello
Yeah, I just would reiterate that",0.0
"Looking at the whole thing from above, there's really pretty good things going on in all of our segments, International, although we mentioned here that there is some planned downtime, that's just operational",1.0
"The earnings power of International is in force and we have these rigs coming on and the looking forward, we think these incremental rigs will be margin enhancing as well",-0.7
"So there is good fundamentals there, NDS, we're -- as we said, we're pretty comfortable there offshore, we have a strong position there as well, and even Canada is looking up for next year as well",1.0
And you've heard that from other people,0.0
"So with US, I guess we're a little more cautious, as William said, with all the macro going on, we thought we'd guide a little more cautiously here in light of everything that's happening",0.2
"
Jonathan Hunter
Understood",0.3
"And then just a follow-up on the Lower 48 on the margin side guiding down only about $200 a day, I'm curious if you mark the whole fleet to where the market rate is today, how much lower would your margin be and how many quarters would it take to kind of get to that level",0.0
"
Tony Petrello
I don't really want to get into that, but I wouldn't say there is a big disparity here",0.0
"
William Restrepo
Between regions",0.0
"
Tony Petrello
Yeah",0.2
"
William Restrepo
So today we only have about 13% of our fleet in those affected regions and our strategy has been not to chase and that's why you're seeing some stability in our -- in our margin overall and our EBITDA",1.0
"And going forward, we don't think it's appropriate to lower significantly our pricing on our fleet",0.0
"We have seen a lot of stability in places like Bakken, West Texas, South Texas",1.0
"So, with 87% of our fleet in those markets, we feel pretty good on our -- with our strategy right now",1.0
"
Jonathan Hunter
Great",1.0
Thanks for taking my questions,1.0
I will turn it back,0.0

Tony Petrello

"
Operator
Our next question comes from Sean Meakim of J",0.0
P,0.1
Morgan,0.1
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Sean Meakim
Thank you",1.0
Good morning,1.0
So I appreciate the comments with respect to some of the moving pieces on free cash flow,1.0
"If we're on this call, a year from now, the 4Q '20 call, if you end up coming short on the $300 million or beating it materially, just I'm curious what are the major flex points in either direction that you'd highlight and thinking about in the context of the things that are within your control versus things that are outside of your control",-1.0
"

William Restrepo
I don't think we have time left to answer that question",-0.1
"
Tony Petrello
I think on the free cash flow, obviously the biggest influencer really would be the actual EBITDA that we generate for next year",1.0
"Now, we are assuming based on what's going on, on our international business and Nabors Drilling Solutions, Canada and some other places that all of that is going to offset whatever happens in the US and -- but that is, that is really, the market is really out of our control, we can mitigate by being smart about our strategy, on pricing and you know, some -- focusing on certain clients and geographies, which is what we've been doing",0.0
"What we can do, we can cut capex further if we need to",0.1
And we can get more aggressive on our DSO collections and some of those issues there,-0.8
"So those are some of the things we can work with, working capital initiatives, more aggressive on selling idle assets",-0.9
So those are some of the comp -- the compensating issues that we could do,0.0
"But I think if we exceed the $300 million, we'll just pay down more debt",-1.0
"If we're a bit short, we'll try to compensate with all the items that we mentioned, which again capex reductions, working capital initiatives and so forth",-0.1
"
William Restrepo
Yeah, I would just reiterate that -- the numbers, the targets that we've said, does target a full year of EBITDA above last year's 2019 number and we have confidence in that as a target, and of course everybody in this Company is going to be measured against that this year as well as the free cash flow target that's pretentious speech of information for your information",0.9
"At the whole thousand SG&amp;A employee base, that's one of the financial metrics for this year, both of those numbers",0.0
"
Tony Petrello
So three quarters of our incentives for this year are coming from basically cash flow",-0.1
"
William Restrepo
Yeah, cash flow",0.2
"So, but the point I'd like to make that -- where Nabors is different in this market is, when we look at the composition of our EBITDA, look at your question with having International and the offshore, and even NDS as mainstays that gives a pretty solid foundation base there that unlike what most of our competitors have, and that we think is really distinguishing feature of what we have, because those things don't move as much against a volatile rig count",1.0
"
Sean Meakim
Well, I think that was pretty specific",0.9
"So Tony, I think you outperformed your own expectations there",0.1
"Just the last thing I would say, so just to clarify, when you talk about free cash you're saying cash from operations less cash from investing",1.0
"
Tony Petrello
That's correct",1.0
"
Sean Meakim
Do you have an estimate of how much asset sales or other items within CFI that are being baked into that free cash number",0.9
"
Tony Petrello
We have some somewhere in the range of $40 million",0.0
"But you know, that happens every year we sell somewhere between $40 million and $60 million of assets that remains stranded, real estate, close facilities",0.0
That's pretty much the number that we do every year,0.0
So that's obviously part of the calculation,0.0
"

"In Q4, we achieved $122",0.0
"4 million in revenue, near the high end of our guidance for the quarter and up slightly year-over-year",0.0
"

Service revenue was $12",-0.1
"5 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 17% and a record for Arlo for the second consecutive quarter",0.0
"For the full year, Arlo reported revenue of $370 million",-0.1
"While this was a decline for the year, Arlo returned to slight growth in Q4 despite our supply shortage and we expect to continue that momentum into 2020",-0.9
Expense management was a top focus as we lowered OpEx sequentially each quarter in 2019 and with our restructuring we are on target to achieve further savings in 2020,-0.3
"Arlo added about 324,000 registered accounts to the Arlo platform in Q4 to reach a total of nearly 4 million total registered accounts, up 41% year-over-year",0.0
"
More importantly, our paid account base continues to grow at a faster pace and reached approximately 230,000 paid accounts, up more than 60% from a year ago",0.8
"As a reminder, this growth does not yet include paid accounts that we were expecting from Ultra, Pro 3 and Video Doorbell customers that received a limited free trial of Arlo Smart",0.9
"Based on early data, we remain confident that when the trial period for Arlo Smart lapses, there will be a further acceleration in the growth of paid accounts through 2020 expect a more fulsome report on this subject on our next earnings call",0.9
"
On December 30, we closed our strategic partnership with Verisure, a fast growing leading provider of professionally monitored security solutions with more than 3 million customers in 16 countries across Europe and Latin America",0.1
"Verisure paid Arlo $50 million for Arlo’s European commercial operations, covering marketing and distribution of Arlo products and services",-0.1
"With this agreement, Verisure also committed to purchase a minimum of $500 million of Arlo products over the next five years to be distributed through first multi-channel go-to market for a consumer security experience",0.2
"Clearly, this partnership has immense financial and strategic implications for Arlo",0.4
It will diversify our revenue on both a regional and channel basis,0.0
"It raises the forecast growth in Europe from 5% CAGR to 25% CAGR over the next five years and all deployments through Verisure’s direct channel will have a one-to-one attach rate to Arlo Smart services, which will further accelerate our recurring service revenue",0.5
"
Overall profitability in Europe is expected to improve over the life of the deal and importantly the deal has substantially strengthened our liquidity",1.0
"With about $75 million in total proceeds and our strong cash management, we closed the fourth quarter with $256",0.0
"7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, a record high for the company and a sequential increase of more than $100 million",0.0
"After closing Verisure, we announced Arlo SmartCloud, a SaaS version of our Arlo Smart service platform",0.7
"SmartCloud is a comprehensive service offering that brings together our expertise across artificial intelligence, computer vision, multi-object detection, audio analysis, scaled storage, real-time events and ecosystem integrations to manage vast fleets of cameras and provide the kinds of customized alerts our Arlo Smart users have come to rely on",0.0
"
Formalizing our intent to grow the partnership and B2B side of our business, this unique offering delivers reliable and scalable cloud services to any company or communities making Arlo the ideal choice for those looking to bring intelligent security solutions to market",0.2
Verisure provides a great first commercial example of SmartCloud’s value and proves our ability to diversify our business to further accelerate our service revenue growth,1.0
I would also like to touch on our newly announced Privacy Pledge,1.0
"At Arlo, we believe in a users' right to privacy and control of their personal information, a belief that’s underscored the design of our products and services since day one",0.2
"

In light of increasing attention on privacy concerns regarding the treatment of user data, our Privacy Pledge reaffirms our commitment to these principles and clearly differentiates Arlo from others in the industry",0.4
Arlo is a company purely focused on providing security solutions that respect and protect our users’ personal information,0.8
We don't collect or retain information that is not required to provide the survey,-0.8
We don't sell data and we are not in any other business that would pull us from our core mission of helping users protect what they care about most,0.9
"The response from our users, our partners and our retailers has been overwhelming and we will continue to provide leadership on this front",-0.9
"Our clear stance makes Arlo not only the ideal company for consumers to trust for their personal security, but also the ideal company to partner and integrate with to bring solutions to market",0.8
"
Moving onto products",0.2
Last quarter we launched our first integrated Video Doorbell that captures the convention – what conventional Video Doorbells can't,-0.1
Our unique smart entry solution utilizes an industry-leading square aspect ratio camera lens with an extra wide 180 -degree field of view,0.1
"This lets users see the visitors from head to toe, including packages left at their front door, solving the biggest complaint users have with existing products on the market",-0.9
"With HD resolution and clear two-way audio, the Video Doorbell delivers direct to mobile video calls for faster response time and comes with a three month trial of Arlo Smart that lets users to get personalized alerts such as packages – package detection, so users can quickly reply or take action",0.6
"
We believe this powerful combination creates the most sophisticated doorbell on the market and provides another lever to drive future paid subscriptions for Arlo",0.7
"And we received numerous accolades to bolster this belief, but none clearer than CNET Editors' Choice award with CNET claiming that “Arlo just ousted nest as their favorite Video Doorbell",-0.7
” CNET named it the best Video Doorbell for 2020,1.0
"And of course our other recently released product, the Pro 3 continues to impress homeowners and industry experts alike",0.4
In January at CES 2020 the Arlo Pro 3 continued its award winning momentum and was named an Innovation Award Honoree,0.7
"Additionally, Pro 3 had garnered editor's choice awards across CNET, PC Magazine, TechHive, Digital Trends, and Gotta Be Mobile",0.0
"
We are honored that the Pro 3 was praised by TechHive as quote one of the absolute best indoor/outdoor security cameras you can buy",1.0
"By CNET, as the best security camera of 2020 and quote the outdoor home security camera to beat, and Gotta Be Mobile as the quote smart home security system that strikes the perfect balance between image quality, smart features, flexible installation and price",0.0
"
Further expanding on our Pro 3 line of best-in-class cameras, we announced our all new Arlo Pro 3 floodlight camera, the first wire-free integrated floodlight camera on the market, featuring class leading bright LEDs, an integrated 2K HDR camera, 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, custom lighting configurations, a rechargeable battery, and a built-in siren and a compact modern form factor that provides the ultimate in place anywhere protection",0.0
"
The Arlo Floodlight Camera joins Ultra, Pro 3 and our Video Doorbell and including a free three month subscription to Arlo Smart our powerful cloud-based AI and computer vision based subscription service",0.2
"
The Floodlight Camera was recognized as a CES 2020 Innovation Award Honoree and won the best of CES awards from bestproducts",-0.7
com and Popular Mechanics and the top tech CES award from Digital Trends,0.4
"The industry action to this new product announcement has also been extremely encouraging and Business Insider remarked Arlo is the gold standard for security cameras, so I have no doubt that it's new product Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Camera will be an excellent device",0.9
"

Furthermore, Gear Patrol called the Floodlight Camera, I quote seriously steroidal floodlight for the security-conscious",0.7
"The Floodlight segment of IP cameras is growing faster than the market as a whole and as you can see these numerous accolades speak volumes on Arlo’s product differentiation, ease of use, and promising growth opportunity",0.9
"
Now I'll turn the call over to Christine for her commentary on our restructuring plan, our activities to add cash to the balance sheet, our fourth quarter and full-year results and our guidance for the first quarter and full-year",0.0
"
Christine Gorjanc
Thank you, Matt",1.0
"Before I discuss the financials in detail, I would like to highlight that we closed the fourth quarter of 2019 with $256",1.0
"7 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, which is a sequential increase of more than a $100 million",0.0
"This cash increase is largely a result of the agreement we completed with Verisure, which increased our cash balance by approximately $75 million and prudent balance sheet management",0.0
"
Additionally, the team did an outstanding job managing working capital, which contributed to the sequential cash increase",1.0
"First, with the sale of the European business and associated inventory, we added $55 million to the balance sheet",0.0
"
Additionally, in Q4, we received a prepayment of $20 million from Verisure for products to be purchased by them in 2020, which will show up as an increase in deferred revenue along with the $2",-0.2
5 million prepayment for engineering development services,0.0
The gain on the sale of our EMEA commercial operations is reported as $54,0.1
9 million in our consolidated financial statements,-0.2
"
Note that this number includes $50 million received for the sale of the EMEA commercial operations, $4",0.0
9 million for the sale of existing inventory in the EMEA distribution center as well as various working capital adjustments including the write-off of EMEA deferred service revenue as well as the $4,0.0
6 million de-recognition of goodwill associated with the EMEA business,0.1
"
As can be seen in our sequential decline in operating expenses, our restructuring activities continue to go well and we are still on the path to get down to a quarterly run rate, $33 million to $34 million per quarter of non-GAAP operating expense by the end of the second quarter of 2020",-0.7
"
We’ve recorded approximately $600,000 of restructuring expenses during Q4 2019",0.0
"Given these successes, we did not need to draw down our line of credit",0.8
I would also like to note that beginning Q4 of 2019 we will change our metric definitions to registered accounts and paid accounts from registered users and paid subscribers,0.9
We believe this more accurately describes our metrics given the Verisure transaction where we are now paid by Verisure for our EMEA accounts as opposed to individuals or businesses,0.0
More detailed information can be found in the supplemental information in our press release,0.0
"
And now onto the financials, as Matt highlighted, we achieved $122",0.0
4 million of revenue in-line with our guidance and up 15,0.0
4% sequentially and up 0,0.0
2% year-over-year,0.0
"During the fourth quarter, we shipped a total of approximately 1",0.0
4 million devices of which approximately 1,0.0
3 million are cameras,0.0
"
We added approximately 324,000 registered accounts to the Arlo platform in Q4",0.0
"As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had about four million registered accounts an increase of 40",0.0
9% from a year ago,0.1
"Growing our registered account base is critical to growing our recurring services business, which we believe will help improve both our margins and our revenue predictability",0.2
"
We are very pleased with the growth in our paid account base and believe our new business model for paid services, which we introduced with Ultra and have also included with Pro 3 and the Video Doorbell and we'll continue with future product introductions will be a substantial driver of the paid account base and recurring revenue growth in the near future",1.0
"

This new business model gives the user a rich experience with Arlo Smart for a trial period and at the end of that trial period, there is no rollback to free storage",0.5
"For services revenue for Q4 2019, was $12",0.0
"5 million, which is up 16",0.0
9% over last year,-0.1
"
From this point on my discussion points will focus on non-GAAP numbers",0.0
The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP is detailed in our earnings release distributed earlier today,0.0
Our non-GAAP gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $14,0.0
"9 million, which resulted in a non-GAAP gross margin of 12",-0.1
2% within the range of guidance,0.0
"
This compares to $5",0.0
"6 million in the year ago, comparable period and $11",0.0
4 million in the prior quarter,0.0
Our service gross margin was 34,0.1
"3% for the fourth quarter 2019, our service gross margin is burdened by the cost of the free Arlo Smart trials under the new business model as well as the accounting carve out for the free basic service",0.0
"But we do expect that once we increase the subscription attach rate, we will see the service gross margin expand",0.0
"
Total non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $36 million, which is down 4",-0.2
6% year-over-year and down 0,0.0
04% sequentially,0.1
Our total non-GAAP R&amp;D expense for the fourth quarter was $14,0.0
"3 million and down $800,000 compared to the prior quarter",-0.1
"
Our head count at the end of Q4 2019 was 349 employees compared to 406 in the prior quarter",0.0
The decrease in head count is equally from our restructuring efforts as well as those employees that transferred over to Verisure at the end of the quarter,0.0
"
We agreed to provide Verisure with transition services as they start to operate the European commercial business",0.0
"These transition services include training time with Arlo employees, systems costs as well as some outside service costs",0.0
"We have included these costs in our normal operating expenses and the reimbursement from Verisure is included in other income and was approximately $800,000 during Q4 2019",0.0
"
Our non-GAAP tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 is $284,000",0.0
"For the fourth quarter of 2019, we posted a non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of $0",-0.6
26,0.0
"As I previously mentioned, we ended the quarter with $256",0.0
"7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments up $102",0.0
9 million sequentially,0.0
"
Aside from receiving cash from the closing of the Verisure deal, we continue to be very focused on managing our cash position and we’re pleased with our inventory management during Q4 and improved DSOs of 97 days for Q4",1.0
"
Now turning to the outlook, we expect revenue in the first quarter to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million",0.0
"As Matt mentioned, coronavirus is impacting our business on the supply side as our vendors do not have sufficient quantities of the required components to fulfill our demand because the component factories are operating at considerably reduced output",-1.0
"
Additionally, in the second quarter we have new product introductions planned that we believe will be impacted by the component shortages as well as delayed delivery of some of the manufacturing equipment from China",-1.0
"To take this into account, we have built in an impact of between 5% and 10% to our original revenue expectations for the first quarter and are expecting an impact between 20% and 25% for the second quarter",-0.1
We are of course working closely with our partners as we navigate through this,0.1
"
For the first quarter we expect our GAAP gross margin to come in between 6",0.0
1% and 9,0.1
4% and our non-GAAP gross margin to come in between 8% and 11%,0.0
We expect our GAAP net loss per diluted share to come in between $0,-0.3
44 and $0,0.0
47 per share and our non-GAAP loss per diluted share to come in between $0,0.0
33 and $0,0.0
36 per share,0.0
"We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax expense to be approximately $400,000 for Q1 2020",-0.1
"
For the full-year we expect revenue between $370 million and $400 million and a non-GAAP operating loss between $65 million and $75 million",-0.3
"Please note however, that we will have the benefit of about $3",0.9
5 million for the year in other income for reimbursement for transition services from Verisure,0.0
"

For the full-year, we expect some of the inventory reduction and working capital benefit we accrued in 2019 to reverse itself out in 2020",0.7
But we believe that we will end the year with more than $150 million in cash and cash equivalents and with that we can open the call to questions,0.0

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Adam Tindle of Raymond James",0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Adam Tindle
Okay, thanks",1.0
Good afternoon,1.0
"I just wanted to start Matt, you talked about the trial period of Ultra Pro 3 Video Doorbell customers still coming that lapsing and potentially accelerating growth of paid accounts, which would obviously be exciting",0.7
"Just hoping for a little bit more color on the data that you guys are looking at to support that view, just from an outsider's perspective, we look at units shipped versus paid subscribers for a sense of attach rate improving and it's not, but just acknowledge that you obviously have more visibility than us",1.0
"So curious on what's kind of driving your confidence behind that statement, what data you guys are looking at internally",0.4
"
Matthew McRae
Yes, for the last couple of earnings calls and quarters, we've been conveying our confidence that, that the attach rate will go up especially on the new business model and actually being driven by the new business model, which to your point is exactly Ultra Pro 3 Video Doorbell so far",-0.4
"We obviously get a lot of internal data and like I said in the script we have some initial data that it allows us to remain very confident as we go forward, but I think we'll hold a more fulsome report in sharing a more statistically relevant and larger sample size for the next quarter's earnings",1.0
"
Adam Tindle
Okay",-0.3
That's fair,0.8
"I guess maybe another question on services, if I could",0.0
I know it's just to key part of the story obviously,0.4
"And you have grown revenue nicely, I think north of 20% for a couple of years now",1.0
But gross profit dollars are essentially flat during that time and margin is in decline that – that services margin decline accelerated in Q4,-0.2
"I think Christine alluded to some of the reasons behind that, but just maybe bigger picture comments on why margin isn't improving with scale, given it's kind of counterintuitive to us in a services business and maybe how Verisure is going to impact that with the one-to-one attach rate",-1.0
"
Christine Gorjanc
Right",0.9
"So Adam when we look at this quarter, we have always we've been carving out from the old products and then we have all of our new products are basically still on free trial, Pro 3 came out during Q4",1.0
Our Video Doorbell came out during Q4 and they have three months trial,-0.2
So those end sort of late in Q1 and then also Ultra,0.0
"So once we start kicking in people paying for services, you'll see the margin increase there",0.0
"And then also as we not as we're not selling anymore the older products with all of this free storage, you'll see that too",0.9
"
And then obviously with Verisure, when we start to see a larger attach rate, especially in their direct channel in a one-to-one attach rate, that will also give us those economies of scale that you're talking about and increase the margin",0.0
"So, we think it's got quite a bit of a way to increase over time",0.0
"
Adam Tindle
Is that $500 million of revenue that you identified related to Verisure the one-to-one attach rate on services, is that at consistent services gross margin as you've been experiencing or is there a way for us maybe to think about the impact because it obviously sounds like a pretty interesting opportunity just trying to help what the margin impact is going to be from it",0.0
"
Christine Gorjanc
Absolutely, that's hardware revenue",0.0
"On top of that, we are paid when any of Verisure’s customers use our service and Arlo Smart and that will be on top of that",0.7
"And so both of that 500 million, both as in the retail channel and in the direct channel, and we're not really giving a breakdown",-0.3
"And to be honest, we're not sure exactly what that breakdown will be going forward, but we're, we're very much, they're very much looking forward to selling this in their direct channel",1.0
"

Adam Tindle
Okay, got it",-0.8
One just quick last clarification,0.0
"Does your 2020 guidance include any benefit that you're expecting from Verisure in any way you can help us with the timing of when that's going to hit, I assume maybe Q3, Q4 more so",1.0
Or is it just the magnitude and timing related to Verisure in 2020 guidance,0.0
"
Matthew McRae
Yes",0.0
"On the last call, we had mentioned that most of the Verisure impact will start in 2021",0.0
"So when we talk about the European growth, for instance, going from 5% CAGR to 25% CAGR, a lot of that will actually start to phase in 2021 with this year being around transition integration and getting both channels and some of the products ready for full deployment through them, especially on the incremental channels beyond the retail channel that they purchased",0.3
"
Adam Tindle
Got it",0.6
That's helpful,1.0
Thank you,1.0

Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Rand of Deutsche Bank",0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Jeffrey Rand
Hi",0.0
Thanks for taking my call,1.0
Just on the gross margin for Q1 is that – how much of that is being impacted by the coronavirus and how do you kind of look at your gross margin trajectory throughout the year,0.0
"
Christine Gorjanc
So it is affected because of some of the fixed costs that are in there and as we're bringing over less materials, those fixed costs become a bigger piece of that or are they hit the gross margin a little bit on that",-0.2
"And then also, you know, potentially we'll end up spending a little bit up more on freight if we do try to air freight some stuff in that as it comes over once it – once the factory starts having a bigger output",0.0
And as we look towards gross margin then it should get better towards the back half of the year,0.9
Q4 is always a little bit less depending on what we decide to promo,0.0
"
Jeffrey Rand
Got you",0.1
Thank you,1.0
"And the lost revenue in the first half of 2020, is that something you expect to recover some of it in the second half or is that just mostly lost revenue",-1.0
"
Matthew McRae
I would say we're working daily on mitigation plans to try and recover as much as possible",0.0
"But in reality, especially on a component shortage when you're losing those POs and replenishment at the retail channel, most of that is lost and we'll get the recovery from a growth trajectory back in the second half",-1.0
"Also when you do a new product launch, which we have several that we’re kind of targeting the spring reset may get pushed out into Q3",0.0
"Those stocking orders will move over, but again any in quarter replenishment and sales that you're having you won't get back",0.0
And so that's why we're looking at that and being very transparent about the impact we see for the first half and what we think will actually happen in the second half for 2020,0.0
"
Jeffrey Rand
Understood",0.1
Thank you,1.0
"
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Hamed Khorsand of BWS Financial",0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Hamed Khorsand
Hi",0.0
Could you just clarify the component shortages you're seeing,-1.0
Is that different from what you were talking about last quarter that impacted Q4,0.0
"
Matthew McRae
Yes",0.0
"
Christine Gorjanc
Absolutely",0.2
"These are factories that were – obviously, they were shutdown for Chinese New Year and normally that's a week",-0.6
Some of them are just coming back online this week and they're coming in anywhere at 20% to 40% capacity because a lot of the cities have had separate shutdowns,-0.1
There are quarantines before they can get in the factory,0.0
"So even though we manufacture outside of China, a lot of our components are coming from China and we are literally on the phone with them every day talking, but those factories are coming back up to speed slowly as their people come back to work slowly",0.0
"
Hamed Khorsand
Are you able to source anything outside of China right now",0.0
"
Christine Gorjanc

We do already source some things outside of China, which is good, but a lot of the major components are still sourced in China",1.0
"
Hamed Khorsand
And this impact that you're talking about in Q2, is this from products that you're planning to release or is this products that you've already released that you’re – the impact that you’re expected",0.0
"
Christine Gorjanc
It'll be a little of both, but we do have some new product introductions",0.0
We talked about the Floodlight already and there is a few more and it will slow those down a little bit as we're doing the builds and getting the tooling and all that depending on how we move forward with that,-0.5
"
Hamed Khorsand
And could you clarify the comment you made earlier in your statements about the Q2, the 20% or 25% impact, is that to revenue and would that mean that revenue would be actually down sequentially in Q2 versus Q1",-0.1
"
Christine Gorjanc
It is to revenue",0.0
"And it’s probably not quite down, probably slightly up",0.0
"
Hamed Khorsand
Okay",-0.5
All right,0.9
Thank you,1.0

Christine Gorjanc
Sure",0.1

Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne of Cowen and Company",0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Jeff Osborne
Yes",0.1
Good afternoon,1.0
"Most of the questions I had have been asked, but just a couple of quick ones on my end",0.0
Can you give us a sense of on the service margins,0.0
What the target is at scale or as Verisure kicks in,0.0
"
Christine Gorjanc
I mean, we're obviously targeting, we'd love to see 50% and above, but we'll continue to make our way back to that",1.0
"And we do believe as we get this attach rate up with our new business model with Verisure, we have a lot of catalysts to really move this thing forward",0.0
"
Jeff Osborne
Makes sense",0.2
Is there any way to book in the attach rates,-0.2
"I know you don't want to give specifics until the next call it sounds like, but is there any kind of a minimum and maximum or any commentary you can make on cameras versus non-cameras",0.0
What you're seeing in terms of attach rates itself,0.0
"
Matthew McRae
Not at this time",-0.9
I don't think there's enough data for us to really comment on that,-0.5
"But again, as I mentioned in the script, the early data we have is, is reaffirming our confidence and we’ll provide a lot more on the next call",0.8
"
Jeff Osborne
Got it",0.6
"And then just a couple of other smaller ones here, I might've missed it, but did you give the NPD share this quarter and how it compared to the third quarter",-1.0
"
Matthew McRae
No, we didn't",0.0
NPD changed some methodology a couple quarters ago,-0.1
"And so, there's no way to really provide an apples to apples comparison",-0.1
"So we don't comment on the market share from that perspective anymore, at least from a numerical perspective",0.0
"We do – obviously, we've had a lot of product introductions",-0.1
We've been trying to share a lot of the product reviews,-0.1
And we know ASPs,0.1
We did a great job holding ASPs quarter-over-quarter going into Q4,1.0
"So the quarter was kind of progressed as expected and we think we did very well in the quarter, especially given the supply shortage we talked about on the previous call",-0.9
"
Jeff Osborne
Got it",0.6
And the last question I had is just the – can you – you mentioned the change in headcount sequentially with the restructuring,0.0
Can you remind us on what the employee count that went to Verisure was,0.0
"
Christine Gorjanc
Right",0.9
So we came down about 57 headcount quarter-over-quarter and it was about 26,0.0
"It was an evenly split the difference, right, I think 26 was Verisure and the balance was part of the restructuring",0.8
"
Jeff Osborne
Got it",0.6
Thank you,1.0
That's all I had,0.0

Christine Gorjanc
Sure",0.1

Okay",-0.8
"Good morning, everyone",1.0
"If we can just make sure all the phones are turned off, it would be great",1.0
"Look, firstly, thank you for - very much for joining us for the 2019 full year results webcast, and it's a pleasure to be here with you, and thank you for joining us in person or also those people through the worldwide web",1.0
"
Today is an end of an era, and it's the beginning of a new chapter for Oil Search being the first time in really 25 years that Peter Botten isn't delivering the full year results",-0.7
"It was Peter's last day as Managing Director yesterday, but importantly, he's still involved with the company, and an actual fact, he's working in PNG at the moment with Beth, and I'll get on to that a little bit more shortly",0.3
"
Oil Search has become a multidimensional entity with world-class assets and performance from our PNG LNG foundation project",0.0
"We've got mature but still very valuable PNG oil production, and we're still working with our joint venture partners to advance the PNG LNG expansion and Papua LNG Project",1.0
"
In addition, our investment in Alaska is turning out very, very well",1.0
"We've had significant resource upgrades, material progress in Alaska with the Pikka road development and negotiations there as well as recent exploration success, which Bruce will go through in the presentation",0.9
"
In this climate - economic climate with a number of firm growth projects, we're very, very focused on capital prioritization, capital management, driving our cost into the lowest quartile and ensuring we deliver superior results and value for our shareholders",0.8
"Clearly, the last 6 months has been challenging for all of us, with the uncertainty on the PNG LNG expansion, the global economy related to coronavirus and we're seeing what that's been doing to markets over the last 2 days",-1.0
"And importantly, PNG is not an orphan",-0.4
"The slowdown has impacted most projects globally, and it's also provided us a window of opportunity for continuing progress with our projects",-0.8
"
I'll leave the disclaimer for you to read at your leisure, but, obviously, that has to be part of every presentation",-0.2
"Importantly, for those who are present today, there are no planned emergencies",0.7
"So if we hear alarms, this will be a real event",-0.1
There's a cascading series of alertness that begins with a warden advising us over the PA that there is an issue,-0.6
"If it increases to a beep, beep, beep over the PA system, at that stage, the warden will ask us to follow the instructions",0.0
"And if it really cascades quickly to a whoop, whoop, whoop, then we will evacuate the auditorium immediately following the warden's directions",-0.7
You'll follow the exodus through the exit at the back of the stage,0.0
"And if you can make sure that you follow to the master area at the junction of Young and Ben [ph] Streets, then please don't wander off because people will be looking for you, and we don't want to create any issues",0.0
"
Now getting on to the agenda of today's presentation",-0.4
"Really, going forward, it's really my intention for you all to meet all of our senior executives who are responsible for core areas of the business",0.7
"But today, in the interest of time, I'll cover the highlights, safety and social responsibility before handing over to Stephen Gardiner, our CFO, who many of you know will cover the financial overview",0.5
"It was our intention for Beth White, who until recently was responsible for the gas and development, but following the integration of the LNG expansion into the PNG business unit is now our new President of PNG business unit, and she is actually currently, as I said, up in Papua New Guinea with Peter, facilitating ongoing discussions related to the LNG expansion",0.3
So I'll cover Beth's areas in the presentation,0.0
"

I'm also very pleased to introduce you to Bruce Dingeman",1.0
"He is President of Alaska BU, and he'll cover all things Alaska, which is proceeding very well",1.0
"And then I'll wrap up with our strategic review, objectives for 2020",0.0
"We also have Diego Fettweis here in the first aisle, and he's our acting Vice President in - Executive Vice President in charge of commercial and strategies and also in charge of gas marketing",0.0
"And Diego and I went around Asia, particularly in Japan, last week talking to our market, so we're very clear and knowledgeable on exactly where the markets are and where PNG sits in that process",0.5
"
But firstly, I'll start off with the operational highlights, and Stephen will go into more detail, but this really captures the highlights for 2019",0.8
Our net PAT for the year was $312,0.0
"4 million, which was down 8% on 2018 and was primarily a result of the lower oil and gas prices realized and also the adoption of the new IFRS accounting standards, and Stephen will go through that",-0.1
"
Our total production across our LNG and operated oil assets was 27",0.0
"9 million barrels of oil equivalent, which was at the lower end of the guidance and primarily due to the outage of our oil production and capping of the LNG in September due to the CALM buoy incident, which necessitated the fixing of one of the 5 chains",-0.8
"I'm very pleased to say that, that issue has now been fully resolved",1.0
"
PNG produced at an annualized rate of 8",0.0
"5 million tonnes per annum, and production was impacted by planned downtime in the first half and also, as I just said, during loading - during the fixing of the CALM buoy in the second half",0.6
We focused the loading on the PNG LNG project and reduced - and cut back the oil production to ensure that LNG offtake was impacted as minimally as possible,0.0
"
We have had incredibly positive resource upgrades with a 96% increase in our 2P and 2C reserves, primarily - resources primarily driven by Alaska, and Bruce will cover that in more detail",0.7
We've also had an increasing focus on unit operating costs,0.0
"And for 2019, we averaged $12",0.0
48 and that included all the upstream pipeline and liquefaction costs,0.0
"
We continued to be a strong supporter of community projects, and we are very pleased to announce that we're paying $0",1.0
"045 a share, taking the full year dividend to $0",0.1
"095 per share, which represents a 46% payout ratio, which is at the top end of our range",0.0
"
Moving on to safety",0.4
"We started off the year, if you remember from Peter's presentation back in August talking about the first half year results, with a less-than-stellar safety performance",0.2
I'm very pleased to say that the team in Papua New Guinea and Alaska has very much turned that around,1.0
"In the second half of the year, we were able to achieve significant improvements in safety, which was driven by increased engagement and oversight of our seismic operations in Papua New Guinea",0.3
"
We're acquiring seismic and land acquisitions in probably one of the most challenging environments in the world",0.1
"And we've also changed to a new contract, but this was no excuse for the safety incidents we saw",-1.0
"We modified our own management oversight, and we are now pleased with the commitment of all involved",1.0
"Safety performance in all areas - other areas of the business has been world class, which is especially pleasing considering the extensive activities in Alaska",1.0
I was in Alaska 2 weeks ago and the temperatures in the North Slope were minus 50,-0.2
So these are incredible conditions in which to operate,1.0
"
If you move forward to the - our reserves and resources",0.0
"We've had a very, very positive increase in our corporate resource base in 2019, as I said, with resources - reserves and resources rising 96% to 497 million barrels",0.9
"Our 2P and 2C gas resources have also increased 17% to 1,682 million barrels of oil equivalent",0.0
"

The 243",0.0
"6 million barrel increase in Alaska 2C resource was related to an additional 116 million barrels following technical work, including the 2019 appraisal wells and that was confirmed by our independent auditor, Ryder Scott",0.0
There was also 127 million barrels increase related to our exercising of the option in July last year of the Armstrong/GMT option following our confirmation of the positive results of the original drilling,0.8
"
Based on 2019 production, we had 27",0.0
9 million barrels,0.0
Our 1P reserves life is 15 years,0.0
Our 2P reserves life is 17 years,0.0
And our 2P and 2C resources life is 60 years,0.1
"We now have an incredible solid platform with significant further additions in both regions, but Oil Search is very, very well placed with respect to our resource base supporting our growth long term",1.0
"
I just want to show the management team because there's been a number of changes and very positive changes that have occurred in our management team, and these have been in preparation for Peter's succession",1.0
We undertook a major review of the optimum business model of the source go to a business unit with clear accountabilities and capital management as well as ensuring that the leadership had the right balance and focus to deliver on our potential in a changing world,0.4
"We've really struck the balance of younger, more dynamic professionals with more experienced executives who have a greater relevant international experience with enhanced accountabilities in a business unit model with corporate center being focused on strategy, capital management and capability",0.8
"We have a great balanced team, and I'm very excited to work with this group to drive the assets forward in a coordinated manner, very focused on capital efficiency",1.0
"
The next slide relates to our social license and responsibility and this links to ESG",0.0
And this is something that is at the core of the DNA in Oil Search,0.0
"We believe that's not only the right thing to do, but it's a clear differentiator relative to our peers in the energy industry",-0.7
It's especially in an industry that's being required to be held to a higher social environmental standard than ever before,0.0
We're looking to build on our social responsibility skills to continue to be a leader in this area,0.5
"As everyone is aware, we've been a major socioeconomic contributor in PNG for many years, and we continue to provide multiple services in health, education, power, infrastructure across PNG, both directly and through our Oil Search Foundation",0.2
"Going forward, as part of our strategic review, we'll actually look to see how we evolve our community engagement and support in PNG to reflect the change in dynamic and focus on long-term capability building off PNG entities",0.7
"
The same corporate ethos has been applied in Alaska, and we've quickly been recognized as a leader in community engagement there",0.1
"And importantly, it's reflected in how quickly we've got the community to support our projects and get our necessary approvals to progress our field operations",1.0
"
In Alaska, we signed long-term access agreements that have benefit sharing and support for local corporations as well as building long-term sustainable businesses with a major focus on long-term community well-being that transcends and goes beyond the period of oil production and also looking at opportunity creation for future generations",0.3
It's been a fantastic outcome of collaboration with the local community there,1.0
"
The growing focus globally on climate change presents challenges but also presents opportunities for us",0.7
Our extensive gas portfolio with infrastructure is ideally placed to support long-term transition and our proposed store developments adjacent to existing facilities ensure that we're in the lowest cost for new developments,0.5
It is a core tenet for any growth that we're focused on in Oil Search,1.0
"

We have established - we've also established dedicated carbon reduction teams to minimize emissions and our environmental footprint",0.0
This is - occurs across the company has been led by a corporate,0.0
"When combined with one of our initiatives, being the potential Biomass project in PNG, where we've already planted over 4 million trees, it has the potential to offset over 4 million tonnes of CO2 over its 25-year project life",0.0
"To put that into context, it is equivalent to offsetting the Pikka development over that period",0.0
"
Oil Search is focused on developing tangible initiatives to align our company with the expectations of our shareholders and financiers",0.0
"This is a core area of focus for our strategic review, which will look to position Oil Search as a leader in the socio-enviro responsibility to make Oil Search a preferred choice for shareholders, investors and joint venture partners",0.1
"
We test our business on all climate change scenarios, and our current business is very robust on the 2018 Climate Change Resilient Report, which indicates long-term resilience in a 2-degree Celsius world",0.4
"In 2019, we also commenced detailed base-lining and carbon mapping across our entire business, which will be the basis for prioritizing our initiatives",0.0
"Our commitment to operate sustainably to date has also been recognized globally by several international institutions, which are listed on the slide",0.0
"
I'm going to hand over to Stephen, who will go through the financial performance, and then we'll move over to Bruce",0.1
"
Stephen Gardiner
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and let me add my congratulations to Keiran on taking the helm",1.0
I'm very excited to work with Keiran,1.0
"I've known him for many years, and I think he's going to do a fantastic job of taking this company forward",1.0
"
So let me provide a quick whirlwind tour through the financial performance of the company",-0.1
"So as Keiran mentioned, our net profit was down on the prior year, down, in fact, by $29 million due to a number of factors",0.0
One of them was the introduction of a new lease accounting standard in 2019,0.1
The net overall impact of that was a reduction in our profit of USD 11 million,0.0
I'll highlight some of the other areas that's impacted our components of our financial results as I walk you through the waterfall chart to highlight some of the other key drivers,0.1
"Our production and sales volumes for the year increased by 11%, which was good news, mostly from the PNG LNG project delivering a record production for the year",1.0
"However, revenue was only up 3% or USD 49 million, was held back by an 11% decline in realized liquids prices and a 5% decline in gas and LNG prices",-0.6
"
Our production costs were 20% higher on 2018, and I'll cover those reasons in a lot more detail on the next slide",0.0
"We also had higher depreciation and amortization driven not only by increased LNG production, but also a 29% - a USD 29 million depreciation of assets that were brought on the balance sheet for the first time as part of the new leasing standard",-0.1
"
We enjoyed lower exploration costs expensed compared to the prior year, really in line with lower exploration activity in Papa New Guinea",1.0
Our effective tax rate just over 30% was in line with the PNG corporate tax rate,0.0
"We did have some other positive impacts on net profit largely due to higher joint venture recoveries on capitalized assets, some insurance recoveries related to prior year work that we couldn't book against those costs, but had to take as other income",-0.5
"And offsetting that, though, was a small write-down of leases that we relinquished during the year, both in Papa New Guinea and Alaska",-0.1
"
Now turning to our production costs",0.2
"As mentioned, our production costs were higher, both in absolute terms and on a unit basis, impacted by a number of one-off factors, such as the residual effects of the 2018 earthquake and the loading buoy damage that occurred in August last year",-1.0
"The loading buoy repair prevented the maintenance costs incurred in the second half of the year spread across all of our projects, including PNG LNG",-0.2
"

Our insurance recoveries were booked in 2019 only against the work done by the PNG LNG project on earthquake repairs",-0.2
We weren't able to book any recoveries against the ongoing remediation work that we did in the oil fields unlike 2018,-0.4
"Our oil projects also took higher maintenance - undertook a higher maintenance and production optimization work programs during 2019, including activities carried over from 2018 that were delayed due to the disruption from the earthquake",-1.0
Normalizing for those issues does show our better unit cost position but not an acceptable one,-0.8
"And as Keiran mentioned, we're very focused on identifying opportunities to reduce our operated oil and gas production costs",0.0
We need to ensure that these operations are sustainable over a longer term and such - and it's a very high priority for 2020 to bring those costs down,0.5
"
Moving on to our cash and liquidity position",0.6
"We generated just over USD 750 million of operating cash flow in the year, again, supported by a very solid contribution from PNG LNG",1.0
"Of that amount, $363 million was invested across a successful Alaskan appraisal drilling program and Pikka pre-FEED activities, completion of the Muruk 2 appraisal well, acquisition of seismic data in both PNG and Alaska, oilfield development and exploration drilling, progression of LNG expansion activities and ongoing implementation of our ERP program",0.5
"
We also used up money to repay $354 million of PNG LNG project finance debt and also returned $206 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends",-0.9
"As Keiran mentioned, the Armstrong option exercise and alignment arrangement with Repsol resulted in a net cash outlay of $386 million during the second half of the year",-0.1
The result of that was to double our interest in the main Alaska licenses,-0.2
"
In summary, the overall liquidity position at the end of the year was USD 1",-0.1
"15 billion, including cash of just over USD 400 million",0.0
The proposed sell-down of about 15 percentage points of Alaskan license interest acquired under the Armstrong option is now planned to occur in the second half of this year closer to the FID for the Pikka development that will certainly help rebuild our liquidity position later in the year,0.7
"
And finally, just turning to the full year guidance",0.0
Our production and operating cost guidance ranges are unchanged from those that we released in the December quarterly report in late January,0.0
And Keiran will provide some more color on the production outlook,0.0
So I'll focus on CapEx guidance,0.0
"
Our CapEx guidance range, excluding the impact of any Alaskan license sell down interest, is necessarily very wide at this point",0.4
We're showing a low of around $700 million to a high of $850 million,0.0
"It reflects the current uncertainty we're facing on the timing of moving into FEED and/or FID on our expansion projects in PNG, in particular, and also Alaska",-1.0
"For PNG, until we have that certainty, we'll be controlling our spend on growth activities, particularly until we have clear line of sight on progressing our 3-train integrated LNG expansion",0.8
"But that spend, once we do have that line of sight, we can ramp up very quickly",0.0
"Our production CapEx guidance includes a Kutubu development well we hope to spud in March, production-enhancing well workovers, work on rebuilding our refinery that was severely damaged by the earthquake and ongoing reliability and risk reduction programs",-1.0
"
Our development spend largely relates to the Pikka development, including majorly works and long lead item commitments, with FID targeted in the second half of this year",-0.5
It also includes a ramp-up of Angore field development activities this year,0.0
"
And finally, our exploration and evaluation includes 2 Alaskan exploration wells that are currently underway, unfortunately, unsuccessful Gobe footwall, seismic acquisition in both PNG and Alaska and considerable pre-FEEd and FEED expenditures to progress the Pikka Unit development and also LNG expansion in PNG",-1.0
"

And on that note, I'll hand back to Keiran",0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Okay",-0.4
"Thank you very much, Stephen",1.0
"Again, Beth White, who is our President of our PNG business unit was going to present this, but as I said, she's doing more important things in Papa New Guinea at the moment, so you'll have to bear with me",0.5
"
In terms of the production 2019, we're finally getting on top of the impact of the earthquake in 2018, which actually took a lot longer than originally planned to get on top of",-0.5
2019 production of 27,0.0
9 million barrels,0.0
"So oil equivalent was 11% higher than 2018 when it was impacted by the earthquake, but still we were impacted by the CALM buoy incident in the third quarter",-0.9
"
Our 2019 highlights included the 8",0.1
"5 million tonnes average rate, which is the highest in a start-up, but importantly, we recorded a daily record of 9",0.0
25 million tonnes per annum equivalent for the project,0.0
"The swift and efficient response for the Oil Search recovery team, together with excellent collaboration with the PNG LNG operator, allowed us to fix the CALM buoy and subsequent repairs as quick as possible, but it did mean that the impact on PNG LNG production was minimized and full production was restored well ahead of the initial expectations",0.7
The company's oil production continued to be impacted by the prolonged return to service during - following the earthquake,-0.6
"But by year-end, and as you will see in 2020, we've completed a substantial amount of this work and we had successfully completed and production is now ramping up, especially being boosted by the successful recent workovers and drilling operations, which were undertaken during the latter part of the year",0.7
"
In regard to our Oil Search-operated fields, we've successfully completed workovers in 2 development wells in Kutubu and Moran, and they've been achieved with excellent safety record with no recordable instances",0.9
"We've actually added over 10 million barrels gross, which is 6 million barrels net incremental oil volumes, and they're currently contributing about 4,500 barrels a day gross or 2,500 barrels a day net and probably most pleasing was the costs were 10% below AFE",-0.8
"
The Moran development well M15 Sidetrack 2 also commenced production in January 2020 at very encouraging rates, and the Kutubu development well and UDT 15 has also commenced production in January '20 also at good rates",1.0
"
Moving forward, we still have the Kutubu development wells despite in first quarter '20, which is targeting the Iagifu reservoir",0.0
"We have a coil tubing program in the second half of 2020, which is targeting cost-effective and incremental production at Moran and Agogo",0.0
We are only allocating capital to those projects that have rapid paybacks and robust at low oil prices,1.0
"
In regard to the 2020 production outlook, overall oil production is expected to be similar to 2019 despite scheduled maintenance in one of the LNG trains in the second quarter 2020",0.0
"In regard to our operated production, where we've substantially and successfully ramped up production in the first quarter this year, we're now achieving rates of over 15,000 barrels a day",0.2
"We still have not been able to access the Northwest Moran area, which is limiting our production, but plans are certainly underway to access the area and recommence production by year-end",-0.9
And these are obviously subject to land owner approvals and access,0.0
"
We've taken the opportunity post the earthquake to really look at our reliability across all of our facilities, a program to understand where the key reliable issues - key reliability issues are and their recourses and a path to establish operational excellence has been in progress since early 2019",0.9
"And we're now seeing the strong production ramp-up towards the end of last year and early this year, which is encouraging in that respect",0.9
"In regard to our nonoperated production, obviously, the PNG LNG production is forecast to be somewhere between 8",0.0
3 million and 8,0.0
"5 million tonnes per annum, and that allows for the rate reductions to accommodate the scheduled turbine and pipeline maintenance",0.0
So our total net production guidance for the year of 2020 is in the range of 27,0.0
5 million to 29,0.0
5 million barrels of oil equivalent,0.0
"

Just to kind of now touch on - again, Beth would have covered this section in terms of the gas development and PNG exploration",0.3
"But Diego and I, as I said earlier, had the pleasure of going through our markets over the last 2 weeks and talking to a number of our customers",1.0
So we're actually very well placed to be able to deal with this section,1.0
"As everyone aware - as everyone is aware, the pathway to moving forward on PNG LNG expansion and the Papua LNG Project has been challenging over the last 8 months",-0.8
"Whilst the Papua gas agreement had been signed and approved by the PNG government, the Pnyang gas agreement has not been agreed and formal negotiations were suspended at the end of January",-0.6
"Importantly, informal discussions are ongoing to find a resolution to the differences and all parties acknowledge the considerable value and savings associated with an integrated 3-train project, especially in the current global economic environment and oversupply of gas projects",0.1
Both Exxon and Total have publicly stated that they remain focused on finding a solution,0.6
"And as I indicated earlier, Peter and Beth are both in PNG this week continuing informal discussions and exploring solutions to the current impasse",0.1
"
PNG's proximity to growing markets in Asia and its advantage over other suppliers in terms of costs is high heating value",0.2
"The fact that this is an effectively a brownfield expansion means the PNG LNG really remains a high priority for all stakeholders, and we're still working to find a mutually acceptable solution for it to proceed",1.0
"
This slide really demonstrates the considerable success and progress that's been achieved in advancing the PNG expansion over 2019, which allows the projects to move smoothly into FEED on the basis of getting an agreeable Pnyang gas agreement",0.6
"Clearly, that's the priority right now and finding a solution which is acceptable to all parties on benefit sharing is a priority",1.0
"
Everyone is very aware of the market and the supply",0.1
"LNG Project is trying to secure contracts for their - for the LNG, but this slide actually is an important one because it really just shows in great detail just how niche the PNG LNG and how superior it is relative to others for getting into the Japan market",1.0
"As I said earlier, I've just returned from the marketing trip, and we were up - met senior executives in Japan, and we're really encouraged by the feedback that we got from the people there",0.2
"It also highlighted the uniqueness of PNG's gas relative to other suppliers given our proximity to market, low regional security issues, high heating value gas and ideal specs for power generation",0.9
There is a continued very high level of interest in participating and securing LNG for our PNG expansion projects in the 2025 time frame,0.9
"
This slide shows just how niche PNG LNG is relative to other volumes coming to the market",0.1
Most of the new volumes are substantially leaner with a lower heating value than PNG,-0.1
"This is shown on the graph on the left, which displays the relative heating value for the various LNG suppliers worldwide",0.0
"It highlights just how well PNG LNG and, indeed, with Papua LNG, even though it is a little bit leaner, is still materially higher than the majority of the gas coming to market",1.0
"
The gas on the right shows the lower heating value gas increasing in supply relative to the availability of high heating gas through to 2025, and it really does highlight why the Japanese markets, particularly, are still very focused on PNG LNG as a viable option",0.8
"When you combine these with the materially shorter transportation distances and the fact that PNG LNG expansion, Papua LNG are predominantly brownfield expansions utilizing existing downstream facilities, the PNG LNG expansion is very well placed",1.0
"

Moving forward into PNG exploration",0.1
Exploration spend going forward in PNG will be limited until there's clarity on the fiscal terms completing - following the completion of the government's review on the fiscal terms for the Oil and Gas Act,-0.3
"Importantly, our 2020 activity is limited to completing our existing seismic obligations and activity around Muruk",-0.1
"And as I said, any future activity will be focused in the near term on the Eastern Foldbelt areas where recent seismic supports very good prospectivity for gas east of the antelope area",1.0
"In 2020, we'll be processing and interpreting the seismic that's been acquired over the area during the last 2 field seasons to determine the viability of any future drilling activity",0.0
"
Due to our recent high levels over the past few years, we have very limited firm commitments, and we don't need to drill any further wells to support PNG LNG expansion",0.7
So we're in a very good place to control our exploration spend,1.0
"
I'm now going to hand over to Bruce Dingeman, who will cover the Alaskan assets",0.1
"
Bruce Dingeman
Thank you, Keiran",1.0
"This introductory slide includes a quote from Wood Mackenzie, and it talks about Oil Search becoming a reliable operator in the region of Alaska",0.3
And it's really an affirmation of our progress since assuming operatorship in March 2018,0.8
It's - the arc of Oil Search's progress in Alaska has really been quite remarkable,0.9
"Since assuming operatorship, we are in our second season of drilling with early civil works now underway",0.1
"
I'd like to now shift gears and talk a little bit about some specific 2019 highlights and accomplishments",1.0
We've built a quality Alaska team,0.1
We've had a successful 2018/'19 appraisal program entering the year,0.4
This was our Pikka B and C wells,0.2
Completion of the Pikka appraisal really indicates that all future drilling will be development in nature in the core field area,0.1
"
Exiting 2019, we'll have a 2-rig program as well that's currently in progress with the Mitquq and Stirrup wells",-1.0
"We've engaged in civil works totaling 40 kilometers of gravel and pads, and this early civil works will be a key part of our early production system",0.5
"
In addition to this, we've done these activities while performing exemplary safety and environmental - environmentally",0.4
"Moving on, Keiran mentioned earlier the resource increase, which was basically from 500 million gross to 728 million gross, which is underpinned by a reserve report from Ryder Scott",-1.0
This represents a 46% increase in gross 2C volumes and excludes the potential from our Horseshoe and other areas where we're doing exploration activities,-1.0
"
The next point speaks to our land use agreement with the community land owner",0.2
"This is a life of field surface access agreement, and it assures a sustainable future for all stakeholders",0.3
"
In addition, we've had several regulatory milestones and approvals that we've met",0.2
We spoke earlier about the Armstrong option,0.0
This is where we increased our working interest from 25,0.6
5% to 51%,0.0
"In addition, we aligned interest in our common holdings with Repsol at a 41%, 49% working interest share, respectively",1.0
We also realized a key record of decision from the U,0.0
S,-0.1
core of engineers,0.0
"On the heels of this, we had a North Slope master plan rezone approval, which was granted to allow us to conduct our civil works this winter",0.3
And then we had a plethora of approvals from the state and other regulatory agency for 2019 and '20 exploration and drilling programs,-0.1
"
Additionally, we're maximizing cooperation with offset operators",0.0
We've had key data exchanges on subsurface information,0.0
We've done a number of community initiatives that are involving both our Alaska and Native corporations and villages and have focused on the areas of contracting and community support,0.4
"Our FEED activities are underway, and we continue to target FID in the second half of this year",0.0
"Finally, on this slide, another key activity is, we've commenced our divestment process seeking to sell down 15% working interest share and have had positive initial response from the market in that regard",0.9
"

So moving on to our Pikka Unit development",0.4
"As mentioned previously, we're targeting the 728 million barrels in the core development area from the 3 drill sites shown on this display: Nanushuk A in the north, B in the middle and C in the south",0.0
This targets the Nanushuk 3 and also some Alpine C reservoirs underlying it,0.0
"
The next point talks about the timing and volumes expected from our development activities",0.2
"We continue to see EPS targeting in the range of 30,000 barrels a day with first oil in late 2022, utilizing the backbone of the road system, which is the middle road out to the ND-B pad location",0.0
"Full field development, we're targeting 135,000 barrels a day in early 2025 from the 3 well pads",0.8
"We've elected to change the planned mean first oil date from late 2024 to early 2025 for several key reasons, first being to align equipment purchase orders with our FID decision gate; the second is to realize a higher confidence of shipping fully complete modules in our sail away so we minimize a high cost labor and tie-in risks on the slope; and finally, thirdly, to ensure that we have ease of tie-in or expansion for our future satellites, much like the Mitquq's success for tie-in purposes",0.4
"
I'd like to make one other point before clearing this slide in terms of our project returns",1.0
"We've shared previously that our breakeven return on capital is about $45 per barrel for the project, which remains our current view",0.0
"Additionally, our breakeven cash cost is about $15 a barrel once we reach plateau",0.0
"Another ancillary point is that for projects like Mitquq, where we build new drill sites that will ultimately tie back to facilities, they have a breakeven cost of capital of around sub-$30, around $27, $28 per barrel",0.0
So some compelling and robust economics for our project,1.0
"
Okay",-0.8
Moving on to our winter activities,0.9
This is the 2019/2020 winter season,0.0
"As I mentioned, we've commenced our civil works",0.3
This includes gravel bridge installation and other gravel-hauling activities,0.0
We're building out the infrastructure for this in service of both the early and main production periods,0.1
We're also doing a drilling program that includes 2 exploration wells,0.0
"As you can see on that map, the Mitquq is east of the core Pikka area and Stirrup is to the Southwest, separated by some 150 kilometers of distance",0.0
"The focus of this winter's program will include not only the road and pad to ND-B, but also pads for our operations facility and also for our processing center",0.0
"If the winter season allows, we'll consider additional scope running up towards our ND-A pad",0.0
"
Just a few highlights for your interest",0.4
This is the largest gravel program undertaken in over 20 years in the North Slope,0.0
"We're pulling from 2 mine sites, running over 40 trucks from 1 mine site and 25 trucks from the other site",0.0
So continuous operation activity,0.2
"Additionally, for the drilling activities, we beat last year's record of spudding the earliest in 43 years with this year as well",0.4
And we've done this with exemplary safety and environmental performance,0.4
"Just for clarity, also, the EPS, the early production system, utilizes a subset of wells, drill sites, facilities and pipelines and roads that are required for full development",0.3
It also helps us level our activity in anticipation of installation of the main facilities,1.0
"
Going into a bit more detail on the winter program",0.1
The Mitquq 1 mother bore was drilled,-0.1
We spudded that well in December 25,0.4
The results are - have been previously disclosed and are included here with over 55 meters in net oil pay and 5 meters in net gas pay at the mother bore,0.0
And an additional 10 meters of net oil pay and 6 meters of net gas pay in the underlying Alpine C interval,0.0
"
It's interesting to note that the gas encountered aids our future needs for fuel and also can help with our enhanced oil recovery needs",1.0
"We've then after completing the mother bore, logging and acquiring that information, we sidetrack to the - about 500 meters away and encountered the same Nanushuk 9 reservoir",-0.1
"We're currently undergoing evaluation of that zone, and have mobilized for completion and testing activities",0.0
"

The final point under that is that it's about 10 kilometers from our planned central processing facility",0.0
So it represents a relatively straightforward tie-back opportunity,0.0
"At Stirrup, we spudded the well about a month later, and this is because it required a more extensive ice road to reach that location",0.6
"We intersected the Nanushuk 9, 0 and we've encountered hydrocarbon shows",0.0
"Currently, we're coring, logging and evaluating the zone of interest",0.4
"However, we have seen enough encouragement that supports a well test decision",1.0
So we are mobilizing to undertake that,0.0
Okay,-0.8
"
So what are the implications of Mitquq",0.0
This slide is quite involved,0.0
I'd like to point first to the map,1.0
"If you look at the map, the Kuparuk River unit, the large field to the east and then the Alpine Field to the west, represent the eastern and western boundaries, respectively, of our acreage, which lies in between with the Pikka field",-1.0
You can see the Nanushuk play fairway highlighted,0.0
"Additionally, there's a prime line that indicates a cross-section and a schematic of that cross-section is shown at the bottom of the display",0.3
It runs from west to east,0.0
So you can see the Willow and other top set plays to the far west,0.0
You can see where our projected Horseshoe block lies with the Stirrup well location,-0.8
"Then moving east, you come into our Nanushuk 2 to and Nanushuk 3 sequences that comprise the main Pikka field",0.0
So we number each of these top set intervals from west to east,0.1
"Moving further east, the orange color ones identify prospective zones of interest, showing the Nan 5, Nan 6 and Nan 7 zones before you get over to the Mitquq, which is actually a Nan 9 interval",0.1
So the point I'd like to make is that we see a rich set of opportunities within the field bounds of our project,1.0
"Additionally, you can see the colors on the Mitquq accumulation show oil with over - gas over top, as does the Alpine below, which, again, can help meet our fuel and EOR needs for the future",0.8
So we see a really exciting set of opportunities that can be high value-accretive benefit to the - bringing high value-accretive benefit to the project,1.0
"So with that, I'd like to hand it back to Keiran to discuss the strategic review",1.0
Thank you,1.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Okay",-0.4
"Thanks, Bruce",1.0
"The Alaska operations is really a stellar success for Oil Search, and you'll see more and more on that as we go forward",1.0
"Just really want to finish up with our strategic review, which you'll see more of in the third quarter this year",0.1
"But importantly, the Board has initiated a major corporate strategic review to set a 10-year plan for the company focus on ensuring we have the capacity to deliver the risk profit value of our assets in PNG and Alaska, and also ensures that we have a sustainable long-term business in PNG that actually evolves with the country dynamics, and that we fully consider global trends and investor market desires to position Oil Search as a partner and investment of choice for all stakeholders",-1.0
"
The last time Oil Search undertook such a comprehensive review was back in 2002 when the initiatives that were set at the time have really led to the successful company that we are today",0.6
"We have engaged the services of Bain, Goldman Sachs and other specialists to work with a dedicated Oil Search team in this process",0.0
"The review will be completed, as I said in early third quarter, with the intention to present to the market and investors at an Investor Day in early September",0.1
"To ensure we develop a long-term strategy aligned with shareholders and interest, we'll also be arranging a number of meetings over the coming months with our shareholders and investors to listen to and collect views and opinions for our consideration",0.5
"Regarding how we currently see the world, it really is Oil Search does have, despite the economic climate that we're seeing in the world at the moment with the coronavirus, we have an incredibly robust position today and our outstanding platform to deliver long-term shareholder value",0.9
"We've got world-class producing assets in PNG and LNG, and the LNG expansion really does have a niche play and a niche opportunity for the North Asian markets",0.8
"We've got material Alaskan oil assets that are very, very close to infrastructure with low breakeven and development costs with major growth potential",1.0
And we have sound operating cash flow and liquidity position underpinned by an increasingly disciplined capital allocation,0.0
"Oil Search also has an industry-leading reputation for social responsibility, and we have over 80% of our PNG workforce comprising of PNG citizens",0.0
"

We've recently signed a landmark use agreement in Alaska that supports sustainable future and cultural preservations for all future generations",0.9
And we have been recognized independently as a top quartile - the top quartile of Carbon Tracker's climate-resilient oil and gas companies,0.1
But the world is definitely changing,0.0
"Energy and transition has a clear direction of travel, but at a highly uncertain pace, creating opportunities and challenges",-1.0
The sociopolitical landscape is evolving more quickly than companies can actually prepare for,0.0
Companies are also facing greater societal expectations than ever before,-0.1
"But importantly, we're very well placed to be able to lead the pack with respect to that",1.0
"
In regard to the strategic review, the company-wide strategic review will actually reevaluate Oil Search's long-term vision, our strategic focus and our path for delivering superior shareholder returns",0.3
We'll establish how we evolve with PNG and how we proactively manage risk to deliver the PNG assets full potential,0.1
"We'll ensure a sustainable, environmentally responsible and profitable operations through a flawless project execution",1.0
And we'll also consider Oil Search's position in the global energy business and how we respond to technological changes and ESG considerations,0.0
It's an area that we intend to be very tangibly at the leading forefront of,0.0
"Importantly, this review will not distract Oil Search's focus on safe, reliable operations, nor will it focus on delivering our key projects in PNG Alaska",0.9
"It will not change our focus on being a lowest quartile cost provided for our projects, nor will it change our focus on being very responsible with respect to capital management",-0.4
"We won't also compromise our core, such as DNA of social environmental responsibility",-0.6
"In fact, we intend to enhance it",0.7
"
So in final, I'll just go through where we are looking forward to in terms of 2020",0.8
"In summary, times are uncertain across so many areas, but we're working to focus our business and make our company a leader in regard to alignment with stakeholders, whether they be our loyal investors, our JV partners, host governments and equally importantly, the communities where we operate or more broadly",0.5
"Put simply, we are focused on 5 areas",0.0
"Still, the highest priority in the company is commercializing and advancing our LNG expansion, focusing on positive outcomes for all parties",0.8
"We're still targeting an optimal 3-train expansion, and we welcome the ongoing dialogue with the PNG government and all parties involved",0.9
"Our second priority is delivering the Alaskan Pikka Unit development optimally through incorporating and expanding our resource base, as Bruce went through, and also optimizing our facilities to ensure that we minimize capital spend whilst maximizing value",0.8
"We're also quite advanced with respect to optimizing the equity, and we actually have some company or a company, up in Alaska, right now, doing some fuel due diligence",0.1
So it really is advancing,0.0
We have an FID decision in the second half of 2020,0.0
"It's our intention to be a model for social environmental responsibility, and we've established dedicated teams to develop material and measurable initiatives to minimize our footprint and emissions",0.0
"It's an area where you hear so much, but you see so little tangible direction coming out of people",-0.1
"
We also want to create a long-term business and development and support local community wellbeing",0.6
"Whilst it's #4, it's probably #1 in terms of priorities in regard to capital management and prioritization",0.0
"We clearly have a focus on Pikka Unit and moving towards FEED, and we're focused on early commercialization opportunities in both in PNG and Alaska",0.0
Discretionary expenditure or expenditure that doesn't have a clear pathway to commercialization will be halted for the foreseeable future,0.0
Our strategic review is clearly going to set the long-term vision,0.1
"It's a comprehensive strategic review, and it's already underway",0.8
"And as I said, the results will be released in September",0.0
"Delivering full value, capital management, investment allocation, consideration of the optimal mix of scale and assets, Oil Search's position in the energy future, our funding, optimizing our operating model in PNG are all key aspects of the strategic review",0.3
"

With that, I thank you very much for your attention, and I'll actually throw it open for questions",1.0
"
James, how do I know that you're always going to be first",0.2
"
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Q -Unidentified Analyst
Okay",0.0
A couple of questions,0.0
"Ad - firstly, congratulations on the appointment by the way, Keiran",0.4
"
Keiran Wulff
Thank you",1.0
"
Unidentified Analyst
So I know that I'm reading into the release too much",-0.5
"But I actually got the impression from the language in the release that you are more optimistic on a P'nyang deal being done than you might have been a month ago, using words like once P'nyang is signed as opposed to if P'nyang is signed, including the cost in your CapEx guidance, for example",0.8
"I'm wondering over the past month, as you've had these informal discussions, do you think the balance of probabilities of a deal being done is something that you're more optimistic on",1.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Look, it's a good question, and one that we anticipated",1.0
The reality is that there's a huge amount of value in an integrated 3-train project for all parties,-0.1
And that really has to be the focus of it for the project proponents,0.0
So what we're looking to do is to ensure that every avenue are pursuing that project and that integration is pursued,-0.1
"So hence, Peter and Beth are up in PNG at the moment",0.0
"But apart from that, I'm really going to say very little",-0.1
And you can also see that both Exxon and Total have publicly stated that their intention is to pursue a 3-train development,0.0
"So whilst the formal negotiations were suspended at the end of January, it was clear that there was potential space for the parties to reach an agreement and that's in that space that we're trying to achieve",-0.2
"
Unidentified Analyst
Okay",-0.7
"Do you think in the absence of a timeline that actually makes it easier to come up with a compromise between the JV and, like, PNG government",0.9
"
Keiran Wulff
Look, again, it's a good question",1.0
"When you negotiate things that have a 30- or 40-year time frame that impact a lot of peoples' lives over multiple generations, you want to make sure that you get it right and that you get it right for all parties",0.9
"So one of the benefits - it's one of the few benefits of the slowdown economically is it's actually given space, a rational discussion between all the parties and that's where we're focused on at the moment",0.8
"
Unidentified Analyst
Okay",-0.7
I wanted to ask quickly about AGX,0.1
Now I presume that pre-FEED would have continued despite the fact that the P'nyang gas agreement had stalled,-0.5
Is the AGX FEED entry predicated on also entering FEED for expansion more generally,0.0
"And really, the crux of my question here is trying to understand whether AGX could actually be used to debottleneck the existing 2 trains",0.0
"Because the share price reaction, a month ago, effectively eliminated all the value for Train 3, but didn't necessarily add back any value the gas resource being able to debottleneck the existing trains",-0.6
"
Keiran Wulff
Okay",-0.4
To answer the first question first with respect to AGX and FEED,0.0
AGX FEED is dependent on P'nyang going ahead at this stage,-0.1
One of the other issues that we saw was that there's been a - there was a substantial increase in gas resources that was announced last year,0.1
So the project is not short on gas resources,-0.5
"But at the moment, the AGX project progressing that through to FEED is really dependent on P'nyang",-0.1
"
Unidentified Analyst
Okay",-0.7
"Would - in the instance so that P'nyang gas agreement was unsuccessful, do you see a pathway to being able to debottleneck the existing trains",-1.0
Whether that's through the lens of technically being able to debottleneck or commercially arranging the gas to go into a larger two train,0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Look, I mean, we're very fortunate to have Exxon as an operator and Exxon has been very successful in maximizing the value and throughput through the existing trains",1.0
And I'm sure there will be a consideration of how we continue to maintain value for all parties,0.1
"But at the moment, as I said, we're very, very focused on exploring all opportunities to pursue the 3 trains because it makes sense for everyone",0.0
"

Tim Gerrard
Tim Gerrard, from Janus Henderson",0.0
"With regard to Alaska, I noticed in the last ConocoPhillips report, they are also looking to sell down their acreage to the East - to the West around Willow",0.0
Does the timing of their sell down have any positive or negative impacts on your 15% sale,-0.9
"
Keiran Wulff
Again, Tim, it's a good question",1.0
"Also, in the release, I talked about delaying the sale until they actually get clarity on some of the citizens' ballot initiatives in Alaska in relation to taxing some of the legacy fields - their 15% also includes some of the legacy field areas",-0.9
"So the reality is, it doesn't impact us with respect to timing",-0.4
"Conoco have their own reasons for it, but talked about limiting their capital expenditure to a certain limit",-0.7
That's why they're looking at divesting up to 25%,0.0
"But having said that, Alaska still accounts for, I think, this year, upwards of 50% of their allocation for expenditure, which highlights just how serious all of us have seen this management play in the area",-0.2
"
Tim Gerrard
But you wouldn't see any opportunity for a single party sort of buying both stakes",-0.8
"
Keiran Wulff
Look, there's always that avenue",0.1
"At the moment, one of the things that we've learnt is to have our hands on their own levers to make sure that we're not reliant on other parties for the successful delivery of value to our shareholders",0.9
"So right now, we're very focused on a simple 15% investment, and we've had a lot of interest",0.9
Okay,-0.8
"If there's no more questions in the room, if people on the - either on the phone would like to ask a question",1.0
"
Operator
Your first question comes from Daniel Butcher from CLSA",0.0
"
Daniel Butcher
A couple of questions",0.1
Just on the Alaska sell down,0.0
"If the market price is not right at the time, would you warehouse a 51% until a year or 2 down the track",-1.0
And how that sort of interacts with your LNG expansion plans and financing,0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Again, it's a good question",1.0
"It's no wonder we haven't thought about, no wonder it's been asked before",-0.1
It's strongly our intention at the moment,0.0
We're seeing strong interest to divest 15%,0.8
It's not a change,-0.2
We moved - last year moved the divestment into this year to take into consideration the Pikka B and Pikka C results and also the expected resource upgrade that was confirmed by the Ryder Scott independent certification,0.3
"
It's our intention, really, to continue with the divestment",0.3
"However, one of the interesting things about the Mitquq result, it really has highlighted that there is substantial additional potential in the area that can be rapidly tied in",-0.2
It's still early days,0.0
The wells are still operational and we're still mobilizing,0.0
We're just in the process of mobilizing testing equipment to both well sites,0.7
"But at this stage, it's our intention to continue with the divestment to a 35% level",0.0
"
If we were to make that decision, it would be a decision that we'd make following the completion of the review of the Mitquq results and also understanding exactly where the P'nyang - the likelihood of the P'nyang expansion occurs, and that's still a couple of months away",-0.1
"
Daniel Butcher
Okay",0.2
And maybe just moving to the Spirit result,0.0
"I mean you mentioned you had oil shows, obviously very preliminary",0.0
"Can you maybe - simplistically, but maybe give us an idea of what minimum flow rate you'd like to see in the test in March, April to sort of indicate profitability and with drilling it further",1.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Look, the key issue here is that the testing will be done on a single zone with a single stimulation",-0.4
So it won't be really indicative,0.0
The important point about that test will really be to - that we get oil recovered to surface at a reasonable rate,0.2
"We're not expecting thousands of barrels, given the constraint of the testing equipment, but we'll give you a very clear indication once we get the test results, whether it's positive or not",0.6
But probably it'd be best to leave it there,1.0
"

Daniel Butcher
Sure",0.1
Okay,-0.8
"Just finally, I mean, just speaking here, but you clearly signaled your intention to focus on the three Train development when you move the JV in the next month or two, but will alternatives also be discussed, like going with [indiscernible] outside",0.2
"I guess following either option does come down to that in the future, might - either bring samples into to Antelope, given it has veto over the foundation project",-0.8
"
Keiran Wulff
There's a lot of hypothesis there that we actually don't control there, Dan",0.0
"Look, the reality is that all of the parties recognize the value that's associated with the 3 Train expansion for PNG and for the stakeholders",-0.1
And especially importance of driving costs as low as possible in the current economic climate,-0.1
"So at the moment, we're very, very focused on that outcome",0.0
"Clearly, at some stage in the future, if all of those things are exhausted, we'll actually relook at the [indiscernible] LNG",-1.0
"But at the moment, the joint venture is very focused on a 3 Train outcome",0.0
So anything other than that's hypothetical,0.0
"
Operator
The next question comes from Saul Kavonic from Crédit Suisse",0.0
"
Saul Kavonic
Keiran, congratulations again on the new role",0.6
"A couple of questions, if I may",0.0
"If I start on the PNG expansion and acknowledging what you say that it's hypothetical, anything other than the three Train expansion, I guess, since that's a hypothetical, I mean, what was the rationale for Oil Search's announcement to shift focus to [indiscernible] on the 3rd of February",0.0
And what has changed since then,0.0
And if I just also may ask a question about contractors,0.0
"I mean there's obviously talk in the market about the EPC contractors and the availability to the old PNG expansion, are those bodies still being held back and being kept warm in able to execute should P'nyang to feed",-0.1
Or at what point - or have we already seen those people move off onto other projects around the world,0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Saul, I'll deal with your second question first",0.1
"Having just come out of Japan last week with Diego and their marketing team, we actually caught up with Chiyoda who also were there, and they're still very focused and committed to supporting feed for the P'nyang project",0.9
"So to answer that question, yes, there is still a commitment and an intention to sort of drive that project going forward with the existing contractors there",0.0
"
With respect to your first question about what's changed in the last month, not a lot, apart from the fact that there's been an ability to step away from something with a specific time frame and look at continually what's in the best interest of all the parties",1.0
"And what's very clear is that a 3 Train project is in the interest of all parties, as I've said before",0.4
"And so that is the focus for everyone, especially when you look at the global economic environment where PNG sits relative to the market, its cost and such",0.0
So we believe that there is the potential to have an opportunity for reaching agreement and that there is potential deal space between the parties,0.0
So that's where we need to focus our attention right now,0.0
"
Saul Kavonic
Thanks",1.0
My second question is on Alaska and particularly the delay of the full-scale development start-up from '24 to '25,-1.0
"Now if I just rewind back to when the Alaska entry happened, and I think you were guiding to a '23 startup for the whole development, subsequent to that, you've obviously cited optimization to get to where we are now",-0.9
"But I'm struggling to see our optimization results in one year early production for the early production section, but a two year delay to the fourth [indiscernible] production",-1.0
I mean have there also just been fundamental delays here for other reasons beyond optimization compared to your entry case into Alaska,-1.0
"

Keiran Wulff
Again, Saul, it's a good question",1.0
2023 was the estimate that when we acquired the asset was the estimate from Repsol and Armstrong,0.2
So we obviously went with what was originally proposed by those parties,0.0
"When we got into the asset, it was quite clear that the area needed to be further appraised and confirmed by the drilling that we did and also some of the information that we were able to share with adjacent operators",0.6
"So very early on, we made a clear decision, and we advised the market that we'd be moving to a 2024 full-scale development and potentially looking at an early production system, where we could not only get early cash flow in 2022, but where we could also use the early activity to drive cost benefits through drilling and others into the overall project development, given the fact that about 1/3 or a little bit over 1/3 of the actual cost of the project are drilling related",-1.0
So there was a lot of rationale in terms of why we did what we did because the scale of the drilling here is that we really wanted to get it right,0.6
"
With respect to the current change, one of the other issues that we wanted to make sure is that especially with the increase in resources that we control, I want destiny for expansion volumes as much as possible",0.3
"And so part of this is to be making sure that in terms of any commercial negotiations or discussions with other parties, we have an ability to add reserves over a period of time",-0.1
That's not discretionary and not reliant on other parties' involvements or other parties' decisions,-0.2
"So whilst it's a relatively short delay, it actually provides also with a lot more leverage and control over its own destiny",-1.0
And there's a lot of rationale and economic justification behind it,-0.6
"
Saul Kavonic
Understood, Keiran",0.3
Good answer,1.0
A quick follow up on that,0.1
"The entry into feed, is that confirmed that there's commercial arrangements to share neighboring infrastructure have been concluded or are they still outstanding",1.0
"
Keiran Wulff
We're very, very close",1.0
The financial arrangements are largely finalized,0.0
"We're just completing some of the outstanding sort of legal issues at the moment, but it's very close",1.0
"Early production is in the interest of all parties, in the interest of our joint venture, it's also in the interest of ConocoPhillips at Kuparuk So we're very confident that there will be an agreement made in the not-too-distant future",1.0
"But the joint ventures move forward with all the engineering and support for engineering feed, and we're progressing with WorleyParsons and other contractors to achieve the dates that we've mentioned in the release",0.8

Lastly, on the LNG marketing, having just come back from Japan and talking about PNG LNG, LNG being differentiated because of its reach, now I think we're aware that, that was very much the market mantra 10 years ago, but at least according to my conversations with market participants, I'm not aware of any recent contracts for LNG, where rich LNG achieved a premium or indeed it might have actually been achieving discounts given some of the operational challenges involved",0.0
Do you actually expect to have a differentiated product because of retail LNG,0.0
Are you aware of any contracts where that is actually being reflected in the pricing that have been conducted over last few years,0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Again, fairly interrogative question",0.2
"So look, importantly, we don't comment on other people's - on other people's pricing or mechanisms for entry",0.0
"I suppose the most important point about the high heating value is if you look at the number of contracts that are winding down out of Japan, coming out of the Northwest shelf and other areas, which are high heating value, Oil Search's and the group's LNG out of Papua New Guinea is very well placed to replace those volumes",-0.1
So that's probably best left there,1.0
"

Saul Kavonic
Thanks, Kieran",1.0
"And apologies, I can just squeeze one last in",-1.0
"On the strategic review, do you envisage that could incorporate looking at M&amp;A beyond Alaska and PNG",0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Look, the important point, the Board - as Rick said at one of Peter's recent farewells, the Board has told us to be brave and consider all different options",0.6
"But having said that, one of the things that was absolutely paramount here is that nothing in the strategic review will remove our focus on delivering the core assets in PNG and Alaska",-0.5
So we won't be doing anything to compromise the delivery of those,-0.3
So it's a politician's answer to say there's always a possibility,0.0
"But right now, we're focused on delivering the full potential of our core assets",0.0
"

Your next question comes from Mark Samter from MST",0.0
"
Mark Samter
Just a quick question, Keiran, a bit of a follow up on from Dan on the slowdown with Alaska",-0.7
"And obviously, macro is about ugly at the moment and maybe becomes not the best times to sell the stake no matter how badly you think it is",-1.0
Should we think FID is no longer contingent on the [indiscernible],0.0
"You would be happy now to FID at 51%, should the macro market [indiscernible] time slow down or would you want to get the slowdown before FDA",-0.7
"
Keiran Wulff
I think the reality is our ability to finance at 51%",0.1
"It's the intention to continue FID, and you have to make a lot of decisions during feed in terms of contracting and others to drive the project forward and were we to delay an FID decision simply on Oil Search's push for a 35% partner, I'm not sure whether our partner would be too pleased with that",-1.0
So it's certainly our intention to progress to FID in the last quarter this year,0.1
Whether or not we keep 51% will be determined by a number of factors,0.0
"But at the moment, it is our strong intention to divest",0.0
"And we've actually seen, as I said, a number of very interested parties",0.3
"And as I said, one is right up in the North Slope, probably not so much enjoying themselves at minus 50 degrees, whatever it is today",-1.0
But it's strongly our intention to move forward with the divestment of 35% ongoing interest,0.0
"
Operator
Your next question comes from James Redfern from Bank of America Securities",0.0
"
James Redfern
Just two quick questions, please",0.0
"Just maybe - first, thinking about maybe, just in terms of recent departure of [indiscernible], who is mainly responsible for gas marketing, is his departure related to, I guess, the delay in PNG brand expansion",-1.0
Or is it more a case of simplifying the organizational structure,0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
It's certainly the latter",0.0
"One of the things that we did, we looked at how to optimize the organization going forward, and it was quite clear that we wanted to push more responsibility for gas marketing into the region",0.0
And so we have substantially upgraded the responsibilities and accountabilities of our Japan marketing office,0.0
"And within a certain period of time, we'll probably be opening a Singapore office to manage both our oil and our gas marketing out of that",0.0
"So it really is a reflection of an evolution of maturing of Oil Search's organization, and we're lucky to have Diego to be in charge of that corporately, and Diego has got a strong background in marketing through his previous role with Exxon",1.0
So it was simply a matter of optimizing the executive structure,0.0
"
James Redfern
Okay",-0.4
"And then just quickly on the potential slowdown Alaska, during the summers of last year, it was suggested that kind of the Japanese trading houses might be interested in farming into the Pikka Unit",-0.9
Is that still the case or should we be thinking more some of the [indiscernible] in Alaska at the moment,0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Again, it's a good question, but it's a combination of both",1.0
"And so there's nothing different to what we talked about last year during the field visit, I'm pleased to say",1.0
"

Operator
Your next question comes from Adrian Prendergast from Morgans Financial
Adrian Prendergast
Just one quick follow-up question on the informal talks at P'nyang",0.0
"And just really, what indication can you give us, if any, on just how far apart the 2 sides are",0.0
"Like, is it as simple as needing to reach a consensus on some sort of price",0.2
Or is it something more material around the government seeking to transform the fiscal model,0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Adrian, I'm pleased to say you've given me the easiest question so far",1.0
"Look, I really can't discuss anything in relation to the discussions that might be occurring or what they're actually talking about",-0.1
We're not the operator of the project and Oil Search's role is just really to make sure that discussions are ongoing,-0.1
"So I'll leave it there, before I get in trouble",-1.0
"
Adrian Prendergast
Fair enough",0.0
And just one quick follow up on - just back to the [indiscernible] of the strategic review,0.0
"Is it, in addition to, as you said, the Board have charged you being bold and looking at all sorts of great options that don't disrupt PNG and Alaska that really just heading in on PNG and Alaska",1.0
Is it also around the emphasis on the 2 in terms of our accountability with the spread between them,0.0
Or is it really just down to ultimately optimizing what you've got in front of you in the current portfolio,0.0
"
Keiran Wulff
Again, it's really - it's an easy question to answer",1.0
It's about value for our shareholders and the speed at which we can commercialize capital optimization,0.2
So one of the things that we see in Alaska is we see a lot of running room for additional growth,1.0
"But importantly, what we don't want to be doing is, in Alaska is, drilling wells that have - aren't going to be commercialized for the next 5, 10-plus years",-0.1
"So for us, in Alaska, it's all about identifying opportunities to tie into existing facilities to either expand or to grow the production base in Alaska quite quickly",0.0
"
In PNG, it's about making sure we deliver on our LNG expansion volumes as optimally for everyone as possible",0.9
We don't need to be out there drilling any more gas wells,0.0
"We just talked very clearly and told the market that's not our intention to drill any more expensive wells that don't see a market for - into the next decade, and that's strongly the case",-1.0
"So we're in a situation now where we're very able to manage our portfolio and focus capital where it's not only most needed, but where it actually adds best value for our shareholders",1.0
"And in PNG, we don't have, as I said in the presentation, we don't have a lot of ongoing commitments",0.0
"
Operator
There are no further questions at this time",0.0
I'll now hand back to Mr,0.1
Wulff,0.1
"
Keiran Wulff
Okay",-0.4
"Look, with that, I'd just like to thank everyone for coming",1.0
"I know it's a long time, and I know that the Caltex presentation is today",0.1
"So look, thank you very much",1.0
And I look forward to a long relationship with all of you,0.2
So thank you for your support of Oil Search today,1.0
Thank you,1.0

John Deere completed the first quarter with a solid performance and sees early signs of stabilization for the U",0.0
S,-0.1
Ag industry,0.1
That's been improved as some progress was made addressing market access for U,1.0
S,-0.1
"farmers through the passage of USMCA, and the phase 1 trade agreement with China",0.0
"
Meanwhile, markets such as Brazil got off to a slower start, even as underlying fundamentals and farm production remains high",-1.0
"At the same time, markets for our Construction and Forestry division slowed, dampening results as the division takes actions to manage inventory levels and adjust to lower levels of demand",-0.1
"
Now, let's take a closer look at our first quarter results beginning on Slide 3",0.0
Enterprise net sales and revenues were down 4% to about $7,0.0
"6 billion, while net sales for our equipment operations were down 6% to about $6",-0.1
5 billion,0.0
"Net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company was up 4% to $517 million, or $1",0.0
63 per diluted share,0.0
The results included a pretax expense of $127 million relating to the voluntary employee separation program conducted during the quarter,-0.7
"
Moving on to review of our individual businesses, we will first start with agriculture and turf on Slide 4",0.5
"Net sales were down 4% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, primarily driven by lower shipment volumes and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by positive price realization",-0.8
"Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points, while currency translation was negative by a point",-1.0
"

Operating profit was $373 million, resulting in an 8",-0.1
3% operating margin for the division,0.0
"The year-over-year increase was primarily due to positive price realization and lower production costs, partially offset by lower volume as well as a $78 million charge relating to the voluntary employee separation program",-0.1
"
Before reviewing our industry outlook, we'll first provide commentary on the regional dynamics impacting Ag markets and Deere operations around the globe",0.0
"Starting on Slide 5, in the U",0.0
S,-0.1
"farmers' sentiment began to show early signs of stabilization during the quarter, as uncertainty surrounding market access abated with the passage of USMCA and the signing of the phase 1 trade agreement with China",-0.8
"
Additionally, U",0.1
S,-0.1
"farm cash receipts are expected to increase in 2020, aided in part, by the recently announced the third tranche of market facilitation payments, which totaled $3",0.2
"6 billion, further enhancing farmer liquidity",0.2
"While market access certainly has improved sentiment, farmers will likely remain cautious until Ag exports to China begin to flow",0.9
"Given the seasonality for soybean demand, exports ports to China are unlikely to increase significantly until harvest season",0.0
"
As a result, we do not expect significant changes in the replacement cycle during fiscal year 2020",-0.5
"Furthermore, at this point in the year, many of our large Ag products are already sold ahead, via early order programs that have now closed",0.0
"
Despite limited changes to the current replacement cycle, we were encouraged by the results of the final two phases of our combine early order program",0.0
"After a slow start, this stronger finish resulted in overall program orders ending up low-single digits in the U",-0.3
S,-0.1
", while down double digits in Canada",0.0
"In total, the program ended down a high single digit on a unit basis, but down just a low single digit on a revenue basis due to price increases",-0.4
"
Meanwhile, our tractor order book for fiscal year 2020 is healthy, with a strong sold ahead position indicating a positive reception to our newly redesigned 8R, featuring an industry first fully integrated four track option for a rigid frame row crop tractor",0.0
"
The strong order book reflects in part, measures we took, during 2019 to manage field inventory, allowing us to produce in line with retail sales in 2020, which is currently still our plan",0.1
"Moreover, the actions we took in 2019, resulted in desirable field inventory to sales ratios, that are significantly below the rest of the industry",0.2
And we'll continue to manage new equipment inventory tightly throughout the year,0.0
"Meanwhile, large Ag used inventory levels are in their healthiest position in years, which is supportive of a stable price environment for used equipment",0.7
"
In contrast to the U",0.0
S,-0.1
", our field inventories, though considerably lower than last year, remain elevated in Canada",0.0
"This is due to challenging industry conditions, namely existing trade barriers on Canadian canola and a declining exchange rate",-0.6
"Net farm income is expected to increase this year, but will still be below long-term averages",-0.1
"As a result, we don't see much change on the equipment replacement cycle in 2020, and we will focus on continuing to reduce our field inventory, so that, we can more closely match production to retail sales in 2021",-1.0
"
Shifting to South America and Europe on Slide 6, record soybean production and favorable exchange rates continue to drive very favorable producer margins in Brazil this year",0.8
"These healthy soybean dynamics, coupled with an improving outlook for sugar prices have improved overall fundamentals for the country in 2020",1.0
"
Despite these sound fundamentals, farmers are somewhat cautious regarding equipment investment, as the impact of shifting trade dynamics have yet to be determined",-0.6
"Brazilian farmers were also anticipating further clarity and possibly better terms on government sponsored financing for farm equipment, which contributed to lower retail sales at the end of 2019 and lower shipments through the beginning of 2020",0.7
"

On that note, in late January, the government announced a new financing program that will begin the transition to unsubsidized market base rates for Ag equipment",0.0
"This development should provide greater clarity on funding options for farmers and potentially support stronger equipment sales, for the second half of the year",1.0
"Meanwhile, sentiment in Argentina remained subdued as farmers adjust to higher export taxes on corn and soybeans",-0.2
"On a positive note, this year's crop is very strong, and margins are expected to be positive even in the face of higher taxes",0.9
"
Moving on to Europe, even though, results, for winter crop conditions have been mixed, overall Ag fundamentals have mostly improved year-over-year, as the north region is recovering from last year's drought",0.5
"Margins in dairy and livestock remained supportive, while wheat prices continue above breakeven levels",0.5
"But, despite the modest improvement in fundamentals, sentiment does remain soft",0.9
"
Concerning Deere's operations within Europe, we continue to drive greater degrees of optimization and focus to our business",0.1
"Over the last few months, we've began work on rationalizing the operations of our sales branches and shifting more resources to our frontline selling efforts",-0.1
"
We are also concentrating our product portfolio towards large Ag, with a deeper focus on precision technologies",0.0
"And we're accelerating the implementation, of our Dealer of Tomorrow strategy in the region, more closely, to what we have done in North America to ensure our channel is appropriately scaled and optimized in order to deliver and support higher degrees of technology in the coming years",0.9
"
With that context, let's turn to our 2020, Ag and turf industry outlook on Slide 7",0.0
"Unchanged from last quarter, we expect Ag industry sales in the U",0.0
S,-0.1
"and Canada to be down about 5% for 2020, reflecting a stable environment in the U",0.8
S,-0.1
offset by more challenging conditions in Canada,0.4
"
Moving on to Europe, the industry outlook is forecast to be flat in 2020, as most regions impacted from last year's drought are expected to recover, with favorable production for the year",0.4
"Furthermore, the outlook for the dairy sector remains stable",0.9
"
In South America, industry, sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat for the year",0.0
"Fundamentals in Brazil remain positive, as a result of high levels of grain production combined with healthy producer margins and restored liquidity in the financing market",0.5
"However, other Latin American markets, like Mexico and to a greater extent Argentina, faced near-term challenges due to the potential for adverse policy impacting the Ag sector",0.3
"
Shifting to Asia, industry sales are expected to be flat, with growth in India offset by slowness in China",-0.5
"Lastly, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U",0.0
S,-0.1
"and Canada are projected to be flat in 2020, based on stable general economic factors",0.5
"
Moving on to our Ag and turf forecasts on Slide 8, fiscal year 2020 sales of worldwide Ag and turf equipment are still forecasted to be down between 5% to 10%, which includes expectations of 2 points of positive price realization and a currency headwind of about a point",0.1
"It's important to note, that our sales forecast continues to contemplate producing below retail demand for small tractors in 2020",0.0
"
For the division operating margin, our full year forecast is ranging between 10",0.0
5% and 11,0.0
"5%, unchanged from last quarter",-0.1
"Additionally, when modeling the full year, keep in mind, that some of our large Ag production schedules include lower shipment volumes in the second quarter, due to factory changeovers resulting from the introduction of the new 8R Series tractor and a limited production build, of the new X series combines",0.0
"
Now, let's focus on construction and forestry on Slide 9",0.0
"For the quarter, net sales of about $2",0.0
"044 billion were down 10% primarily due to lower shipment volumes and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by positive price realization",-0.8
"Operating profit moved lower year-over-year to $93 million, primarily due to lower shipment volumes as well as $24 million in expenses relating to the voluntary employee separation program",-0.1
"On the positive, price realization and currency benefited profit for the quarter",0.8
"

Let's turn to our 2020 construction and forestry industry outlook on Slide 10",0.0
Construction equipment industry sales in the U,0.0
S,-0.1
"and Canada are forecast to be down between 5% to 10%, reflecting mixed economic indicators and elevated levels of field inventory",-0.1
"For the year, employment, GDP and housing starts all remain stable drivers of demand, while oil and gas CapEx and rental CapEx are mostly down year-over-year",0.3
"
Moving on to global forestry, we now expect the industry to decline 5% to 10% this year, with the U",0.1
S,-0.1
"and Canada markets declining more than the rest of the world, as lumber and pulp prices soften in North America",-0.1
"
Moving to the C&amp;F outlook on Slide 11, Deere's construction and forestry 2020 sales are still forecast to be down between 10% to 15% compared to last year",0.0
"The year-over-year decline is driven mostly by a mid-single digit under production to retail construction equipment volumes, compared to the building of inventory in 2019",0.0
"The order book remains within our historical 30 to 60 day replenishment window, and is consistent with our outlook",0.4
"
Our net sales guidance for the year, includes expectations of about 1 point of positive price realization and a currency headwind of about 1 point",-0.4
"For the division's operating margin, our full year forecast is ranging between 9",0.0
5% to 10,0.0
"5%, unchanged from last quarter",-0.1
"
Let's move now to our financial services operations on Slide 12",0.1
Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company was $137 million in the first quarter,0.0
"For fiscal year 2020, net income forecast remains $600 million, which contemplates a tax rate between 24% and 26%",0.0
"The provision for credit losses in 2020 is forecast at 18 basis points, reflecting a high degree of credit quality within our current portfolio",-1.0
"
Slide 13, outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow",0.0
"Before reviewing the components of our guidance, it's worth noting that we are monitoring the coronavirus situation and working closely with the Chinese provincial authorities, primarily focused on the wellbeing of our employees and a safe return to production",0.8
"In terms of overall exposure, the biggest potential impacted Deere is in relation to the supply base that serves our international operations",0.0
"The situation remains fluid, and we're working closely with our suppliers and logistics providers",0.0
"
Our full year outlook for net income remains unchanged and is forecast to be in a range of $2",0.0
7 billion to $3,0.0
"1 billion, with an effective tax rate projected to be between 22% to 24%",0.0
Cash flow from the equipment operations forecast is also unchanged and expected to be in a range of $3,0.0
1 billion to $3,0.0
5 billion in 2020,0.0
The guidance reflects a potential $300 million voluntary contribution to our OPEB plan,0.0
"
I'll now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell, for closing comments",0.1
Ryan,0.1
"
Ryan Campbell
Before we respond to your questions, I'd first like to offer some thoughts on current market conditions in Ag, and revisit some of the key initiatives we have underway in 2020",0.2
"
After a year of uncertainty in 2019, we're encouraged by early signs of stabilization evident in the beginning of 2020",-1.0
We view the signing of the phase 1 trade agreement with China and the passage of USMCA as important first steps for removing some of the uncertainty that has weighed on producer sentiment over the last year,-1.0
"
Continued positive sentiment will be dependent in part, upon a pickup and U",0.7
S,-0.1
exports of agricultural goods to China,0.1
"Over the last quarter, we were pleased with the conclusion of our combine early order program and the progress made, on our large tractor order book",1.0
"As Brent noted, orders for our combine program ended up in the U",-0.1
S,-0.1
"
We are finding that despite, periods of high uncertainty, customers continue to invest in products and services that drive economic value",-1.0
"Customers are increasingly opting for solutions that offer the highest levels of productivity, driving a better outcome for their operations, and higher average selling prices for us",0.8
"We view this as evidence, that we can drive growth and our financial results even in periods, when the number of units we sell is flat to slightly down",0.5
"

Now, shifting our focus to 2020 and beyond, recently discussed, some key initiatives to help us better execute our strategy",0.9
"During our CES Analyst Day, John May, laid out his priorities as CEO",0.1
"Our first priority is to refocus our capital allocation on investments that one, intensify our precision Ag leadership",0.1
"Two, expand our aftermarket and retrofit business",0.0
"And three, increase our emphasis on products and markets that have the greatest opportunity for differentiation",0.9
"
Our second priority involves reorienting our cost structure, including both our organizational design and footprint to create a more agile company, to best capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us",0.8
"To that end, we conducted a voluntary separation program during the first quarter, as a step towards achieving greater degrees of agility",0.5
"
Over the course of the year, we’ll pursue additional opportunities pertaining to our overseas footprint and organizational design",0.1
"We believe the resulting organization will be more efficient and better equipped, to respond to dynamic market conditions",1.0
"As we have indicated, we will provide updates on these initiatives during our quarterly earnings calls, as decisions are made",0.0
"
Brent Norwood

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you",1.0
We will now begin the question-and-answer session,0.0
[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Jerry Revich
Yes",0.1
"Hi, good morning everyone",1.0
"Ryan, I'm wondering if you could just expand on your last comment in terms of organizational structure and the opportunity set from realignment",0.0
Correct me if I'm wrong,-1.0
I think you folks are set up as a matrix organizational structure with very heavy emphasis on shared services,-1.0
"And so when we've seen these transitions in the past, towards direct regional responsibility, there has been really significant benefit at the margin line pretty quickly",0.5
So how should we think about your transition here as an organization compared to what we've seen from others that have had similar transition from matrix to regional responsibilities that you outlined here,0.0
"
Ryan Campbell
Yes, Jerry, thanks for that question",1.0
We're still going through the analysis of what it might look like,0.0
"And what I would point to is, now when we talked to CES and we talked about our bridge from mid-cycle margins from 12",0.0
"5% to 15%, we said about 1% would come from cost structure",-0.1
"Certainly, the voluntary separation program that we just executed is a component of that, the Wirtgen synergies is a component of that",0.0
"
And then the footprint and kind of the recharacterization of the organizational design will be the rest of that",0.0
"And so if you think about 1 point would be over $300 million, we took about - we’ll get about $120 million in savings from the voluntary separations programs, we did in 2019 and 2020",0.0
"The Wirtgen synergy is €125 million, you get about a similar amount for the rest of it",0.0
"
So, we're early at, we'll talk as we make those decisions, but that’s how we would characterize it at this point",0.0
"
Jerry Revich
And Ryan, the ultimate opportunity set, could it be bigger than that",0.2
"I guess, when we've seen these changes in the past, we've seen something closer 200 basis points to 300 basis points of margin improvement",0.6
"Is that what your benchmarking shows, or is it too soon to talk about numbers of that size until we're further along",0.0
"

Hi, good morning everyone",1.0
You touched on seasonality of China purchasing of U,0.0
S,-0.1
"Ag commodities, but as we think about getting into the fall and post the phase 1 agreement",-0.1
"How are you thinking about that level of activity, whether that should return to a pre-trade dispute type of purchasing, whether it'll be stronger than just based on your evaluation of the phase 1 agreement",-1.0

Ryan Campbell
Joe, thanks for the question",1.0
"I think, it's certainly still early",0.0
"I think, as Brent alluded to, we're at a period of time, where typically now you see the purchases moved to South America, coming back to North America kind of post our harvest time",0.0
"So, we think there is some time like there",0.0
"
I think the real question is, as we think about how do we get to a larger number of purchases, and some of the numbers that have out there are roughly 2 times what we've done kind of historically on historical averages",0.0
"So, I think it's still early to determine exactly what that looks and also what commodities make that up, play a pretty big role, is it a continued purchases of soybeans or do we see other commodities things like pork, ethanol and others come into the trade that necessarily haven't always been there haven't been significant",0.3
"
So, I think a lot of questions still there, in terms of how that comes through, as well as in the near-term with coronavirus and some of the things that have slowed, just overall activity in China, what impact does that have on their ability to make those purchases",0.0

Stephen Volkmann
Hi, good morning, everybody",1.0
I wanted to dig in a little bit to your view of the Ag margins,0.0
"Obviously, they came in quite a bit better than I think, some of us expected here in the first quarter",1.0
"And frankly, it's a little tough to kind of hold them down into the level you've given in terms of guidance for the full year",-1.0
"When we think about the tailwind from the headcount reduction savings and probably some kind of mix improvement, I would assume, and maybe a little bit more production to retail versus last year",0.6
"
Are there some headwinds that we should be thinking about that kind of offset some of those benefits",-0.5
"Or is that maybe somewhat of a conservative outlook or are we skewing toward the higher end of the margin range or something, just a little more color on how you're thinking about that",0.0
"
Ryan Campbell
Yes, Steve, I mean, you're right",0.9
"First of all, I think that we were pleased with the way the first quarter came in, margins up on lower sales, I think that's a positive",1.0
"As we think about the full year, I think a few things that we are contemplating",0.0
"One, it is still early",0.0
"We're watching the situation in China with coronavirus closely, as well as in Brazil, where, as we've noted, we've started the year with a little bit slower retail activity",-1.0
"Our view there's that picks up, it's more back-half loaded, but that's something we'll watch pretty closely",0.1
"
One other thing, as we think about first quarter versus the rest of the year, the first quarter we had a nearly 3 points of price realization",-0.1
"Our full year is about 2 points, so, not as much expected there from that perspective",-0.1
"So, overall, not a change in our range, and we think, there's still a lot of moving pieces, so we feel like that's prudent",0.0
"
Maybe one thing to call out in particular, as we think about the second quarter, and Brent alluded to in his comments, is our second quarter, we have a few, I'd say, maybe unusual seasonal impacts in the quarter",-0.2
"One, we see much lower cotton sales in 2Q of this year, because they came through the first quarter, so that's really just timing of production",-0.1
"But also, we have a new product transition in Waterloo, for our brand new 8R tractor, as well as limited production builds for our new combine",0.1
"And the result of those two things, will certainly impact what we're able to produce and ship during the month",0.0
"

And then one last thing to think about in 2Q is, as we think about coronavirus, and some of those impacts, one of the things that we've thought about is the impact on our supply base there, and the ability to get parts to our operations internationally",0.0
"So, we've actually, in our second quarter included about $40 million of cost of expedited freight to make sure that we're able to have that availability to get parts into the operations",0.0
"So that, all of those things result in, probably a lighter topline and margin line for 2Q than what we seasonally would see",0.0
"
Josh Jepsen
Yes",0.0
"So Ryan, maybe overall just to summarize, we certainly feel good about the performance in the first quarter",1.0
"But, there's a few moving pieces for the rest of the year, and it's too early for us to change our range at this point",-1.0

Hi, good morning",1.0
"Just following on to Steve's question on the Ag margins, again, I agree with his thoughts that the guide seems conservative",0.0
You did also talk about some of the actions you're taking in Europe within Ags,0.0
"So, I'm wondering if there's any costs associated with that or how much that sort of incrementally if any weighing on the Ag margins relative to how I think about margins in South America or there U",0.0
S,-0.1
for Ag,0.4
"So, that's my first question",0.0
"
And I guess my second question on the flip side, the construction margins were a little weaker than I would have expected, understanding, you kept your margins the same, but just sort of your confidence level there, if there was anything in particular that weighed on the construction margins in the first quarter",-0.5
Thank you,1.0
"
Josh Jepsen
So on the Ag side, starting the Ag side, I mean, I think as we think about Europe, some of the things we've already done, we executed on in 4Q of '19 and in 1Q, so, as we stand today, with where we're at, nothing additional to call out",0.0
"If we do further actions, as Ryan mentioned, we'll lay those out and talk through those, but nothing major contemplated right now",-0.1
"
As you think about construction and construction in the quarter, we had lower margins, the voluntary separation expenses $24 million, have an impact, and then lower volume, unfavorable mix, and then just the under production component are really the biggest drivers of that lower margin in the quarter",-1.0
"
Maybe just a context and as we think about the full year, and what do we see there, we do expect to see mix improve as we go through the year, as we expect, our construction North American construction equipment mix will improve as we under produce less throughout the balance of the year",1.0
"In addition to that, road building, which is more seasonally skewed, is a bigger portion of our total C&amp;F business this year, and is much more heavily weighted their seasonality to 2Q and 3Q in the year",0.0

So, I think those are probably the biggest drivers on the construction side from a margin perspective",0.0

Hi, good morning",0.9
Thanks for taking the question,1.0
Appreciated the color on the supply chain impact and the costs you guys are budgeting for the second quarter,1.0
"Just wondering if you can maybe expand on, and I think you said that the component you make in China for other international markets, I'm just wondering if there's any supply chain type impacts that could come over time with the virus spreading to Japan and South Korea",-0.9
"
Josh Jepsen
Yes, so when we think about kind of the impacts and potential impacts of the coronavirus is kind of two components like that we mentioned",0.0
"One is direct exposure, our sales into the China market that's relatively small for our Ag and turf business and for our traditional C&amp;F business",0.0
"Road building, though, has a bigger exposure there",0.0
So road building in China will tend to be 10% to 15% of their overall sales,0.0
So more of an impact there,-0.1
"
We did see some reduction in their topline as a result of the lack of activity in that market over the last month or so",-0.3
So we have seen some of that impact,0.0
That's one,0.0
"
The second component is on supply chain",0.0
And we've got suppliers in China that supply our operations across the globe,0.0
"So, those are the suppliers we're watching closely, we're working through our supply management teams working really diligently to understand where each of those are, and the process to either, are they producing or when are they going to begin to produce, so that's something we're watching and monitoring closely",0.9
"
As a result of that, as I mentioned, that's where we did go ahead and set up and get capacity to expedite freight to make sure we can try to get those parts to our facilities during the quarter",0.0
"
Ashish Gupta
But if we remain in sort of an extended shut down or you see impact from quarantining in South Korea or Japan, do you see any impact there",0.0
"And I guess, I should ask also, do you have other component suppliers that you can leverage in other regions in the Europe or U",0.0
S,-0.1

Josh Jepsen
Yes",0.0
"I mean, first, I'd say it's really fluid and very early",-0.1

"And as always, our supply management teams are always looking at opportunities to resource and leverage suppliers that have multiple locations",0.7

Josh Jepsen
Yes",0.0
"From a cash flow perspective we maintain the range, we're focused on managing inventory and receivables",0.0
We saw really good progress as you noted in the first quarter,1.0

"We took inventory out throughout the balance of '19, so that inventory reduction evens out over time, significant in the first quarter, but it evens out, although we do still project an inventory reduction",0.0

With respect to the buyback, we did around $100 million for the first quarter, that’s in line with our historical average",0.1

David Raso
Well, I'm just trying to figure price cost was 1",-0.3
97 positive for the first quarter when you add the price change and the production cost change,0.2
The rest of the year implied pricing is another $340 million or so,-0.8
Do you think your cost go back up,0.0
Because I'm just trying to get the walk here from you are implying something about the decrementals on the volume declines for the rest of the year,0.0
But the savings from the separation cost within this division in the next nine months roughly should offset the incremental freight in the second quarter,-0.1
"Is that the right way to think about those two moving parts, separation savings versus the $40 million freight cost from coronavirus in 2Q",0.7
"
Josh Jepsen
Yes",0.0
"Well, I think it's maybe a little more - there is a little more than trying to just compare one or two components",0.0

It also benefits profitability for those producers in those markets as well,0.8
"So, there's puts and takes on both of those",0.0
"I mean, I think importantly, as we think about this, from our perspective is, where are - the fact that we continue to see demand growing, consumption of grains growing, and there are only a few places that produce these grains, particularly soybeans, en masse, at scale, and in that relatively low cost of production",0.2

So, we think, those places are the U",0.0

", Brazil and Argentina to a lesser extent",0.0

And along those lines just on Brazil again, why wouldn't farmers be spending money now than if they - if favorable financing is going to disappear midyear",-0.9

Josh Jepsen
Yes",0.0
"So, I mean, I think, well, we talked about a little bit, I think the some of the caution there has been around trade",0.9
And you see a significant shift in China's purchase pattern,0.0
I think that's paused the market a little bit,0.0
"And I think we saw this over particularly at the end of last year and into this year, a little bit of the concern on financing",-0.6
"I think one other things we've seen as the government came out and talked about Finame, as we go forward, I think that's helped eliminate some of the big concern as we've now talking about our program that begins the transition to less subsidization or less interest rate equalization as referred to in the market, and getting to more of a free market system",0.8
"
And I think, a couple things that support that, one is we've seen pretty low interest rates, the benchmark rate in Brazil is at very low levels, which has been positive",1.0
So that certainly helps,1.0
"
And our largest customers in Brazil for quite some time, have had access to bank, private bank financing",0.0
"So, we actually believe the longer-term as we begin this transition that this will create more stability in the market, and less volatility in the Ag machinery sector, because it will be more driven by actual demand and not finance availability or alike",0.8
"
As it relates, maybe one other note on Brazil, the lots of folks look at the shipment numbers coming out of Brazil, in Anfavea, and as earlier noted, someone made the comment we've seen weakness, as you noted, why are we seeing more activity",-1.0
"
One thing that we have seen as we've looked at that market, and you look at by horsepower, splits or segments, there's been a pretty big distinction",0.1
"It's really been occurring over the last three years, where we're seeing high horsepower, and in their reporting that's above 130 horsepower has been growing, whereas, you've seen lower horsepower has been declining year-on-year",-0.5
"And even year-to-date, we're seeing the lower horsepower ranges down double-digits, while we're up on the high horsepower side",0.0
"
So, there are a few dynamics there, but certainly, the growth in high horsepower and technology, we see a very positive, over the last few years that certainly helped to drive the market share gains we've seen and we think that continuing trend helps us, and particularly as you start to deliver more and more precision Ag into the market",1.0

I think the uncertainty we've been dealt with over the last 18 months has caused a lot of that",-1.0
"But I think talking to dealers, talking to our team, I mean, certainly there's appetite and interest there",0.6
"And when we can deliver not only productivity, but cost reduction, when we think about overall P&amp;L for a farmer, there's value there",-0.4
"
Canada, maybe a little bit different situation, where we see the age of that fleet is a little younger",0.0
"And as a result, and Brent alluded to this in his comments, maybe a little bit further out to some of the replacements",-0.1
Just given that market did not cycle us as much down or up that we saw in the U,-0.1

Our next question or comment comes from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley",0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Courtney Yakavonis
Thanks for the question",1.0
"Maybe first, if you guys can just talk about the pricing expectations",0.0
I think pricing was a little bit better than we expect in the first quarter,1.0
And you did raise it for the year but still implying that pricing little bit worse,-1.0
"So maybe, can you just talk about where you saw the strength this quarter and why it should decelerate an Ag for the remainder of the year",0.7
"
And then secondly, kind of on the back of the last question",0.0
"I think when you talked about North America large Ag, the industry outlook staying at down 5%",0.0
It definitely sounds like U,0.1
S,-0.1
is a little bit better than you originally expecting and Canada's a little bit worse,-0.8
"So, when you have been talking about no change in the equipment replacement schedule, maybe first I just wanted to make sure that was saying that the pause that you thought happened last year is going to continue into 2020",-0.1
And then I think you've historically talked about commodity prices,0.0
And what level you think commodity prices will impact the replacement schedule,0.0
And if you can just kind of give us some type of framework for where commodity prices need to go before you start to see that replacements schedule to pick up again,0.0
Thanks,1.0
"

Josh Jepsen
So, I think, as you think about the down 5% on large Ag in North America, you're exactly right in that",0.9
We see probably a little bit of improvement on the U,0.9
S,-0.1
side and weaker on the Canada side,-1.0
So that’s a very fair,0.9
We talked - Brent talked a little bit about what we saw U,0.0
S,-0.1
versus Canada on combines,0.0
We see kind of a similar impact as we look at large tractors from an order book perspective,0.0
So that kind of the dynamic that we've seen there,0.0
"
As you think about price and how we came into the quarter, for C&amp;F, we expect a point, we got about a point in the first quarter and we expect that for the year",0.0
"On the Ag side, a little bit stronger price in the first quarter than our full year",-0.8
We actually saw some improvement in overseas markets,0.8
"So, that was, and the margins helped us a little bit, pushed us a little bit above what we had expected, I mean, into the quarter",1.0
"
Courtney Yakavonis
And then lastly, on the commodity prices and impact on replacement",0.0
"
Josh Jepsen
So, I mean, I think the easing of trade tensions and opening up of market access, we think is really important as the first step",-0.3
"I think, importantly, I think folks want to see grain actually flowing, grain actually moving purchases occurring",0.0
And we think that’s particularly important,0.0
"I mean, as you think about absolute prices we've felt - believe that in the range of $3",0.0
50 corn and $9 soybeans can drive replacement demand that’s supportive of replacement demand,0.7
"
So, I think, if we actually start to see grain move, I think that provides a little more confidence in terms of the access actually being there",0.8
And we think is supportive of replacement demand,1.0
So we'll go ahead and go to our next question,0.0
"Thanks, Courtney",1.0

Our next question or comment comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America",0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Ross Gilardi
Thanks for squeezing me in guys",1.0
I got cut off for a couple of minutes,-0.2
"So hopefully, nobody already asked this",0.2
"But could you clarify what the year-on-year swing in dealer inventories was in Ag and turf just reason being if you look at your retail sales, it's hard to tell what the number is in totality, but it looks like it's down more than the 4% revenue decline you had in the quarters",-1.0
Any color there I would appreciate it,1.0
"I'm just trying to get at whether or not dealer, restocking contributing meaningfully to be maybe less than expected revenue decline in Q1",-0.5
"
Josh Jepsen
Yes",0.0
"I think when we look at it, inventory to sales, in particular, if we look at kind of 100 horsepower and above, year-over-year it came down from 38% to 31% and combines we saw come down as well",0.0
"I think overall from a small tractor perspective, we're relatively in-line with the industry and maybe down a little bit from where we were a year ago",0.0
"But I think overall, we've continued to feel good about where we are from a large Ag perspective and the plans to execute for small tractors",1.0

Ross Gilardi
Okay",-0.3

Thank you",1.0
And our last question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Jerry Revich
Thanks for taking the follow-up",1.0
I'm wondering if you could talk about the margin improvement plans for C&amp;F specifically,0.5
"So, a lot of what we've spoken about precision Ag and their pricing, is really focused on the Ag part of the equitation",0.0
I'm wondering if you could just have a little bit of a discussion on the opportunities for the C&amp;F side beyond the Wirtgen synergies to get closer to that 15% corporate target,0.0
"
Josh Jepsen
Yes",0.0
"Thanks, Jerry",1.0
"I mean, I think you know, maybe at a high level when we think about 15%, that is the margin level we expect to deliver",0.0
"Our businesses may not all be exactly that number, but all contributing to getting there is probably an important distinction",0.0
"But as we think about our construction business, and in particularly as we add in road building, which we feel like has a strong margin profile as well gives us an opportunity",0.8
"

I think, from a technology perspective, we do see opportunities to be able to leverage some of the things that we've done on our Ag business into our construction business",0.1
"So, we think there is opportunity to add and create value there for customers, which is an important component that’s further out",0.0
But we think there's opportunity there,0.0
"I'd say, today, very, very focused on managing the business, managing inventory, integrating Wirtgen and delivering on those synergies that that would be the near-term focus areas",0.0
"
Jerry Revich
Thank you",1.0
"
Josh Jepsen
Yes",0.0
"And maybe the one last thing that we talked about at our Analysts Day at CES is the aftermarket opportunity in retrofit, and I think in particularly in construction, the ability to take care of that product over the lifecycle from a parts and service perspective, leveraging telematics and those sort of things that we have today, we think can deliver margin opportunity for all of our businesses as we go forward",1.0

Michael Ferraro
Good morning, everyone",1.0
Welcome to Alumina Limited’s results presentation for the 2019 full year,0.5
"Before I proceed any further, please note the disclaimer",0.0
"
Alumina Limited had a strong year in 2019",-0.7
Net profit after tax was $214 million,-0.4
"Excluding significant items, the net profit after tax was $327 million",-0.2
The major impact on profit was lower API prices,-0.1
"
The company declared a fully franked dividend of US$0",-0.1
"036 per share, bringing the full year dividend to $0",0.0
08 per share,0.0
This was on the back of record production at AWAC’s operated current refining portfolio,0.1
AWAC’s average cost of production fell 7% and remains in the bottom quartile of producers for both bauxite and alumina,-0.2
"
And AWAC continues to focus on the most profitable part of the aluminum supply chain",0.1
We expect that aluminum demand will return to positive growth in 2020,0.9
This will contribute to the global aluminum market being balanced this year,0.8
"
The long-term market fundamentals for aluminum and alumina remain positive, and AWAC is poised to benefit from any growth in the market",0.9
Alumina Limited shareholders have received solid fully franked returns over several years,-0.9
The company’s balance sheet is strong and we are well positioned in the current commodities cycle,1.0
"
Both our company and Alcoa are committed to ensuring the ongoing sustainability of our operations",0.1
Our 5 refineries emit significantly less CO2 per tonne of alumina produced than the industry average and are in fact in the lowest quartile of this measure,0.0
"
The chart on the appendix on Slide 25 shows our performance relative to other global refineries",0.0
"In both Western Australia and Brazil, AWAC operates in environmentally sensitive areas and the rehabilitation works undertaken are world-class",0.2
Real focus is biodiversity and ensuring that land is returned to its original state post mining operations,0.0
"
This effort has been recognized by independent parties",0.0
All AWAC-operated mines and refineries in Western Australia and Brazil have received certification by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative,0.0
"The ASI Performance Standard defines environmental, social and governance principles with the aim to address sustainability in the aluminum value chain",0.0
"
In addition, AWAC has a goal to enhance water use efficiency, especially in water-scarce locations and are seeking to identify opportunities to become less dependent on water by examining technology, use of secondary water sources and increased recycling",0.2
"
At AWAC’s Kwinana refinery, freshwater usage has reduced by 1",0.0
2 gigaliters annually due to the implementation of press filtration,0.0
A further reduction of 2,0.1
5 gigaliters annually is expected at the Pinjarra refinery once the filtration system has become fully operational,0.0
"

AWAC’s freshwater intensity has reduced by 8% from 2015 to 2018",0.0
"Also, Alcoa, who operates the AWAC assets has been recognized as the top aluminum industry performer in the S&amp;P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2020",0.0
"
I’ll now hand over to Grant to provide a more detailed review of the full-year results",0.1
"
Grant Dempsey
Thank you, Mike, and good morning all",1.0
"I’ll begin with a detailed look at the full-year performance of AWAC, before coming back to how this translated into Alumina Limited’s 2019 Financial Results",-0.1
"
The decline in the Alumina price index throughout 2019 significantly impacted our average realized alumina price for the year",-0.1
"Despite this, AWAC continued its recent history of impressive results, recording an EBITDA of $1",0.8
26 billion and a net profit after tax of $565 million,-0.1
"
Excluding significant items, which largely related to the announced closure of Point Comfort, EBITDA would have been $1",-0.6
59 billion,0.0
I’ll now go through AWAC’s operating performance in more detail,0.0
"
Improved stability and process efficiencies in our refineries throughout the year generated reliable and consistent operating performance, resulting in significantly higher aluminum production",0.8
The 12,0.0
6 million tonnes of alumina produced by AWAC was the highest-ever annual total for the current portfolio of refineries,0.0
"
2019 saw both the Pinjarra and Wagerup refinery have record production years",0.1
AWAC ended 2019 with fourth quarter production of 3,-0.4
"2 million tonnes, with each of our refineries heading close to or about full capacity",0.0
"
For 2020, AWAC is forecasting a further slight increase in production",0.0
"With 94% of tonnes sold on an API linked or spot basis, AWAC’s realized price closely follows the performance of the API",0.0
"The API was adversely impacted in 2019 by lower-than-expected smelter demand, the ramp-up of the Alunorte refinery and additional alumina supply from other refineries around the world",-0.5
"
In line with the decline in API, AWAC’s average realized alumina price fell by 25% to $336 per tonne",-0.1
"Despite softer alumina prices, AWAC continued its proven track record of delivering strong margins and returns throughout the cycle, underpinned by its world-class low-cost refineries",0.0
"
AWAC’s cash cost to production declined steadily throughout the year with the average cash costs for 2019 improving by 7% to $210 per tonne",-0.4
"The average for the fourth quarter was down to $200 per tonne, a $23 improvement over the corresponding period in the prior year",0.8
"
Increased production and a favorable exchange rate positively impacted our conversion in bauxite costs, particularly in Western Australia where AWAC benefits from the close proximity of the refineries to its long-life low-cost bauxite mines",0.3
"
AWAC’s key input costs of caustic soda and energy were also lower throughout the year",0.5
"However, we do expect an increase in energy costs from July 2020, as AWAC transitions to some new gas contracts",0.5
"All other things being equal, this transition will increase AWAC’s cost in 2020 by approximately 2",0.0
5%,0.1
"
Turning to capital expenditure, CapEx is $56 million lower in 2019 at a $177 million",0.0
2018 was elevated largely to the installation of press filters at the Pinjarra refinery,-0.1
"2019 significant projects included the completion of the Pinjarra press filtration facility, new and upgraded residue storage areas, and detailed planning for the upcoming crusher move at the Willowdale bauxite mine",0.0
"
Growth CapEx in 2019 largely centered around the debottlenecking and boiler upgrades at the Alumar refinery and the evaluation of the West Australian brownfield expansion opportunities",0.0
These WA opportunities continue to be evaluated and the decision will be made during the course of the year,0.0
"
Sustaining CapEx in 2020 will be higher, largely due to $90 million that was budgeted for the crusher move at Willowdale, having already spent $14 million in 2019",-0.1
"We expect that the move will be completed before the end of 2021, with the total project cost estimated at about $135 million",0.0
"

I will now talk to AWAC’s outlook for 2020",0.0
We expect a strong operating performance to continue with a slight increase in alumina production forecast to 12,0.0
7 million tonnes,0.0
"As usual, scheduled maintenance and overhauls will be skewed towards the first half of 2020 having a seasonal impact on production and costs",-0.5
"
CapEx is budgeted to total approximately $265 million covering significant projects like the Willowdale crusher move, finalization of the WA expansion evaluation and planning for a potential plateau move at our Juruti bauxite mine",0.0
"
Restructuring items impacting cash are forecast to increase to $115 million as remediation begins on the recently closed Point Comfort refinery and has accelerated at Suralco following the handover of the Afobaka Dam to the Suriname government",0.1
"It should be noted that there will not be a repeat of the large 2019 tax balloon payment, which related to the 2018 results",-0.1
"As noted in our 4E, the Australian Tax Office recently issued a statement of order position to Alcoa of Australia in relation to certain historic third-party alumina sales",0.0
"
AWAC disagrees with the ATO’s position, and the matter is now subject of an independent review process within the ATO, which may or may not result in tax assessment",-1.0
AWAC intends to defend the matter through all available avenues of dispute resolution in the event that an assessment is ultimately issued,-0.9
"On raw material costs, we expect the recent decline in global cost prices to flow through into the first half of 2020",-0.2
"And as mentioned, gas prices will be elevated in the second half",0.0
"
Now let’s turn to Alumina Limited’s results",-0.2
"Despite the decline in API, Alumina Limited recorded a good result, return cash to shareholders and continue to maintain a strong balance sheet",0.4
"The company recorded net profit after tax of $214 million, excluding significant items and net profit after tax would have been $327 million",-0.6
"
Alumina Limited announced a fully franked final dividend of US$0",-0.1
"036 per share payable on the 17th of March 2020, bringing the total annual dividend to US$0",0.0
08 per share,0.0
The average dividend over the past 3 years equates to a strong 8,0.0
6% dividend yield for shareholders before franking,0.0
"
Alumina Limited has a $350 million facility with the earliest maturity date of any debt tranche not until October 2022",-1.0
"The company’s debt at year-end was $70 million, equating to a gearing level of just 3%",-1.0
"Our investment in AWAC’s portfolio of low cost world class assets together with a strong balance sheet, allows Alumina Limited to deliver consistent returns to shareholders throughout the cycle, while also supporting investment for the long-term",0.2
"
Thank you",1.0
And I’ll now hand back to Mike to provide you with an overview of the market,0.0
"
Michael Ferraro
Thanks, Grant",1.0
World primary- and semi-fabricated aluminium consumption contracted in 2019,0.0
"The transportation, machinery and equipment sectors led the decline",0.0
"Otherwise, stagnant construction and electric industries as well as a poor macroeconomic environment, all contributed to an overall 1% contraction in global primary aluminium demand",-1.0
"However, more favorable monetary policy, easing of U",0.7
S,-0.1
"and Chinese trade tensions, stronger packaging demand and positive sentiment in global markets, particularly in emerging markets like China and India, are expected to drive the primary aluminium demand up in 2020, by around 2",0.1
3%,0.1
"
Some Chinese economic slowdown due to the coronavirus appears likely and demand for aluminium may be reduced, but lost production would likely be recovered after the situation is resolved",-1.0
"Hubei Province has only one small aluminium smelter, however, there are supply chain disruptions in China affecting bauxite, alumina, aluminium and other raw material flows",-0.5
This has resulted in a spike in the API as China imports more alumina to satisfied smelter production needs,0.9
"

Due to the level of uncertainty in the potential impact of the coronavirus comments in this presentation on demand and supply, and the market this year assumes there is minimal net financial impact from the virus",-1.0
"Despite subdued prices, alumina production grew by 3",-0.2
8% outside China in 2019,0.0
"This was driven largely by the resumption at the partially curtailed Alunorte refinery in Brazil, and ramping up of the Al Taweelah refinery in the UAE, the Friguia refinery in Guinea and the Lanjigarh refinery in India",-0.1
The Alpart refinery in Jamaica announced a large capacity curtailment in 2019,0.0
The alum refinery in Romania reportedly curtailed at least 20% of its production,0.0
"
2019 saw a moderate smelter-grade alumina surplus of 1",0.0
"5 million tonnes outside of China, most of which was exported to China",0.0
Non-China primary aluminium production is expected to increase by 3,0.0
8%,0.1
"However, we are forecasting a 2 million plus – a 2 million tonne surplus of alumina outside of China in 2020",0.0
As alumina growth exceeds metal production growth,0.9
The surplus is expected to be exported to China to balance the global market,0.0
"
In China, smelter-grade alumina production contracted by 1",0.0
"2% in 2019 tightening environmental policies, lower alumina prices and increase in net imports, all contributed to the contraction",0.0
"In May, over 4 million annual tonnes of capacity were curtailed in Shanxi due to bauxite residue issues, of which 2",-0.1
8 million tonnes remain curtailed,0.0
"Difficulty in accessing domestic bauxite, plus narrowing margins forced more high cost refineries in Northern China to curtail during the second half of 2019",-1.0
"
China returned to being a net importer of alumina in 2019 with net imports totaling 1",-0.5
4 million tonnes after being a net exporter in 2018,-0.1
"Net alumina imports by China are forecast to increase of 2 million tonnes this year, below the 10-year average of 3 million tonnes",0.0
"Over the medium to longer term, China is expected to be broadly balanced in alumina, while continuing with modest imports from time to time",0.6
"
Going into 2020, Chinese smelter-grade alumina production is forecast to grow by 1",0.0
8%,0.1
Chinese alumina capacity growth was slowed down significantly in recent years from its peak of around 45% in 2007 to around 3% in 2020,0.3
Any new capacity will mostly likely display existing high-cost capacity,0.0
It’s not expected that there will be Chinese over production of alumina in the medium to long term,-0.3
"
New, more cost-effective refineries are likely to be built along the coast of China, or in bauxite-rich regions outside of China",0.4
"However, in the outside of China, greenfields alumina refinery projects continue to be challenged by high construction costs and distances between energy sources and good quality bauxite",0.9
"
Starting in 2018, a range of environmental control measures have forced bauxite mines to close in Henan and Shanxi creating a bauxite shortage in Northern China and driving domestic bauxite prices up",-1.0
"China currently imports about 50% of its bauxite needs, up from around 30% 5 years ago",0.0
This is expected to increase to over 75% within the next 5 years,-0.2
"
This would have led to an overall material increase in the average cost of alumina production in China in 2019, where not for lower caustic prices, which have dropped around 30% since the start of last year",-0.5
"This meant a slight drop in Chinese alumina cash cost, although the cost was high than the average of the previous full years",-0.3
Forecast imported bauxite trajectory into China is expected to add cost to China is refining,-0.1
"
In the next 5 years, non-Chinese smelter-grade alumina consumption is forecast to maintain a 3",0.0
5% compound annual growth or 10 million tonnes more alumina,0.1
"Over the medium and longer term, aluminium demand is forecast to continue to growth through economic expansion and increasing intensity of use",0.1
"In developed countries, this is expected through most stringent environmental requirements to reduce emissions and waste, and increase efficiency, leading for example to greater lightweighting for transport and electrical vehicles",-1.0
"

In developing countries such as India and Southeast Asia, aluminum demand growth is expected through greater urbanization with more infrastructure and construction",0.7
"To summarize, despite subdued markets, alumina limited had another strong year in 2019, thanks to our world-class low-cost global assets",0.7
"
The global alumina market is forecast to be balanced in 2020",0.0
"As trade frictions subside, coupled with recovering construction and automobile industries, aluminum demand and production growth is forecasted in 2020",0.3
"
We remain positive on the long-term outlook for alumina and aluminum",0.2
"Chinese demand for imported bauxite continues at a high rate, which is met by ample supply, but helps underpin generally higher production costs",0.9
"
The impact of coronavirus, if short-term, will have limited impact on industry fundamentals, given the likelihood of a strong rebound in economic activity after such a crisis",-1.0

Question-and-Answer Session

Ladies and gentlemen, we’ll now begin the question-and-answer session",0.0
[Operator Instructions] The first question we have is from the line of Rahul Anand from Morgan Stanley,0.0
Your line is now open,0.0
"
Rahul Anand
Hi, Mike and Grant",0.0
Thanks for the opportunity,1.0
I’ve got 2 questions,0.0
First one is around the refinery studies,0.0
Are we still expecting these back in the first half of this year or has there been any delay,-1.0
"And then, following on from that, what’s your view re these studies, especially in the current pricing environment, how you’re viewing the potential expansions",0.0
That’s the first one,0.0
"
The second one is, if you can help us, perhaps with some data-points around where you think the Chinese production costs might be sitting at this point in time",1.0
"And in your opinion, do you think the cost deflation re the Guinean bauxite use, has that trend completely played out now or is there a bit more to go there",0.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Grant Dempsey
It’s Grant Dempsey",0.2
I’ll answer the first question on the WA expansion and Mike will cover the other one,0.0
"So I think we’re still expecting around sort of the end of the first half, early second half, for those decisions and for recommendations",-0.1
The work is ongoing,0.3
"I think as we said in the last half, we’re looking more closely at sequencing them and working through how that all might work to limit any sort of operational impact",0.0
"
Obviously, as always, and as we have always said, we will take into account the long-term market for alumina as we work through it",0.5
"So, yes, the short-term is obviously a factor",0.0
But it is something we are working through,0.0
So I don’t have much more of an update now in terms of actually what the recommendation will be,-0.1
"But I would hope over the next 3 to 4 months we will get to the point where we make a decision not only on whether we proceed, but how we proceed with each of those opportunities",1.0
"
Rahul Anand
Okay, understood",-0.3
Thanks,1.0
"
Michael Ferraro
On the Chinese production costs, they’re averaging at the moment just below $300",0.0
"And so there has been a drop in the last year, as I mentioned earlier, driven by caustic – reduction in caustic prices of around 30%",0.0
We think the caustic prices have stabilized,0.0
We don’t see them dropping much further this year,-0.9
"
In the context of Guinean bauxite, I suspect that will continue to add production cost in China because of the lower alumina content relative to historic domestic bauxite within China, which requires more processing, more red-mud residue disposal areas",-1.0
"So I think the longer-term trend, as more Guinean and foreign bauxite is imported into China, the costs will continue to increase",0.0
"
Rahul Anand
All right, sorry, Mike, If I may come back with a follow-up",-1.0
My understanding was that the Guinean product tends to use lower caustic and hence that was leading to some cost deflation out of China,-0.1
"Do you think the trend is…

Michael Ferraro
It does use lower caustic, but it’s offset by more organics and a greater amount of non-bauxite residue in it",0.2
"So I’m not sure how much one offsets the other, but our general view is over time the costs will be higher using Guinean bauxite",0.0
"
Rahul Anand
Understood, okay, thanks a lot for that",1.0

Thank you",1.0
The next question we have is from the line of Paul Young from Goldman Sachs,0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Paul Young
Yeah, morning, Mike and Grant",0.5
First question is on unit cost,0.0
"Grant, just to clarify, your comment on the gas price increase or the impact, you said it was 2",0.0
5% increase in the second half of this year and that’s at the group level,0.0
So should we – should we be applying that to the $210 average for 2019,0.0
"
Grant Dempsey
Yes",0.1
"
Paul Young
Okay",0.2
Thanks,1.0
"And the next one is just on cost trajectory out of the fourth quarter, which was $200 a tonne",-0.1
"Caustics fallen another $30, $40 a tonne into December quarter",-1.0
Currency is down,-0.2
"If you run on a spot unit cost across your portfolio, where would your costs roughly be at the moment",0.0
"
Grant Dempsey
Look, I think – again, not that – it was fourth quarter, obviously, at $200",-0.4
It’s not that dissimilar,-0.1
We don’t think for the first quarter,0.0
"Mainly driven by, as I said, there is always some seasonal maintenance stuff that happens in the first half of the year, that sort of offsets some of the operational side of it",0.0
"So there is a little way to go, as I said, in caustic",0.0
"And the dollar, obviously, we don’t run a spot one on dollar on a daily basis, but that’s obviously lower again",-0.1
"
So I think that will have given us some – so the tailwinds into the current first quarter",0.4
But that is offset a little bit by some increased maintenance,0.0
"
Paul Young
Okay",0.2
Good to know,1.0
"And then a question on the one-offs, one-off costs, just stepping through maybe focusing on Point Comfort and also Suralco, some pretty big cash outflows there, of which Point Comfort, we sort of knew that number",1.0
"But just curious about will that extend into 2021 and I think, previously, Mike, you mentioned on Suralco that the 6 years of basically restructuring charges",0.0
"So is that still the case, so we should be factoring in another 5 years of, call it, $40 million of cash outflows at Suralco",0.0
"
Grant Dempsey
It doesn’t go evenly",-0.4
"So with Point Comfort, I think as we said, the majority of the $151 million cash that was announced is in the first 5 years",0.6
"That’s just – that’s not including holding costs, which we have – which is included in that $55 million for next year",-0.2
That does come down,0.0
"It holds into 2021 a little bit, but then does sort of materially come down over the following 3 years",0.0
"And in terms of Suralco, that spend is elevated for the next few years as well",0.0
"
Paul Young
Yeah, thanks, Grant",1.0
I’ll pass it on,0.1
I appreciate it,1.0
"
Operator
Thank you",1.0
The next question we have is from the line of Lyndon Fagan from JPMorgan,0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Lyndon Fagan
Thanks very much",1.0
The first question is just on the gas prepayments,0.0
"I guess, you said previously it starts to amortize in the second half of this year",0.0
I’m wondering if that cost guidance of costs up 2% already includes the gas credit if you like or should we be thinking about a credit to the cash flow statement as that gas prepayment amortizes,-0.2
"And then, if so, how much is that",0.0
That’s the first one,0.0
"
Grant Dempsey
Yeah, that does net it off",0.1
So that’s a cash – we’re trying to get as close as we can to a cash cost for alumina,-0.1
So we’ve already – the 2,0.0
5% is net of the amortization of the prepayment for that portion,0.0
"
Lyndon Fagan
Right",0.8
"So just to be clear, there is no credit, if you like to that",-0.3
"It’s just – if it weren’t for the prepayment, the actual cash cost would be up significantly more than that",-0.6
"
Grant Dempsey

It would be up high, yes",0.0
"
Lyndon Fagan
And what – how would it look without that gas prepayment",-0.1
"Would it be up 5%, the growth level",0.5
Or – I’m just wondering how much is amortizing this year just to get a clean number to model going forward,1.0
"
Grant Dempsey
I haven’t got that number in front of me",0.0
"But it is sort of half of the $500 million prepayment over sort of 5 years, and it’s relatively straight line amortize",0.0
"So I haven’t done the calculation in terms of how it works out per tonne, but that’s sort of the broad numbers",0.0
"
Lyndon Fagan
Okay, great",1.0
And then moving on to the expansion,0.0
"What’s your position with the WA expansion, if Alcoa doesn’t want to do it",0.0
"So I’m just wondering, can you go at alone",-1.0
Or what – where does that leave things,0.0
"
Michael Ferraro
Lyndon, I think, if Alcoa doesn’t want to proceed, I would expect it to be on the basis of fundamentals",0.0
"And if that was the case, we would probably be aligned on that basis",0.0
"If there are other reasons not to proceed, such as limitations on CapEx and where to allocate the money, then we don’t have the option to proceed on our own",-0.3
We don’t have a sole risking right at this point in time,-1.0
So that – both of us would have to agree to proceed with it,0.0
"
Lyndon Fagan
Great",1.0
"And I guess just the final one, in terms of the cash restructuring charges for the period, I can say, they’re obvious on the P&amp;L statement",0.0
But what was the cash outflow this period from all the restructuring,-0.2
"
Grant Dempsey
I think in our Slide 24 is – about $80 million, which is – it’s on our outlook page, it’s going from that $80 million to $115 million in 2020",0.0
"
Lyndon Fagan
Right",0.8
Okay,-0.8
"Thanks, guys",1.0
"
Michael Ferraro
You’re welcome",0.9
"
Operator
Thank you",1.0
The next question we have is from the line of Kaan Peker from Jefferies,0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Kaan Peker
Hi, Mike and team, thanks for taking my questions",1.0
Just 2 for me,0.1
"Just with the energy cash cost increase, but it appears to be coming through in the second half, so that 2",0.0
5%,0.1
"If we sort of look into 2021, should we be doubling that",0.0
"And secondly, on the mine sustaining CapEx, we sort of talked about the WA operations, but should we expect Juruti to sort of start increase in CapEx spend in 2021 and sort of flow into 2022 and 2023",0.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Grant Dempsey
Yeah, so Grant here, so on the energy cost, yes, that is the correct assumption",1.0
"So for 2021, we’ll have a full year impact of those contracts going up, which would sort of be a 5% from where we are today, obviously, not on top of 2020",-0.1
"In terms of Juruti, look, part of the assessment, we’re doing for some of the sustaining CapEx this year is actually doing the work on what the right time for the potential plateau move that Juruti would be, so that decision hasn’t been made",0.7
"If it is made, then there will be some elevated CapEx after that",0.0
But the timing hasn’t been worked through in terms of whether that’s 2021 or 2022 or later,-0.8
We’ve still got lots of different options in terms of managing that CapEx versus OpEx,0.0
"So I suspect, again, that’s a decision that will be made through the course of this year",-1.0
"
Kaan Peker
And I suppose, what’s driving that decision",-0.1
"
Grant Dempsey
It’s – what drives most of the mine sort of crusher move decisions or plateau moves is really just winding up when the optimal time for OpEx, which obviously increases as you get further and further alive from where the ore is",0.9
This is actually moving closer to it,0.0
So that’s just a lot of modeling and a lot of work through in terms of when the right time to do it is,0.0
"And usually, crusher move is a sort of every 6 or 7 years, it happens depending on various factors",0.0
"
Kaan Peker
Sure",0.1
Thank you very much,1.0
"
Operator
Thank you",1.0
The next question we have is from the line of Glyn Lawcock from UBS,0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Glyn Lawcock
Good morning, Mike",1.0
"

Michael Ferraro
Hi, Glyn",0.0
"
Glyn Lawcock
Hi",0.0
"Just a couple on the cost, if I could",0.0
"And just firstly, I noted, Grant, that the 2",0.0
5% and then the 5% cost imposed in 2021 is net,-0.1
"But I would have thought, you take the full cost through the P&amp;L, and then, you just unwind the prepayment on the balance sheet",0.0
"So your unit cost guidance is, you said, net of the prepayment, but what actually goes through the P&amp;L would be the full cost imposed, would it not",-0.1
"Just want to make sure, I understand that",0.1
"
Grant Dempsey
Yes",0.1
So this – the guidance we give on cost is always a cash cap,-0.1
"So it’s not cost of goods sold pure accounting, it’s the actual cash cap that we work through",-0.5
So they are 2 different measures,0.0
"And yes, you’re right",0.9
The full cost goes through the P&amp;L,0.0
"But obviously, we start to reverse out the – we start to amortize the prepayment from July 2020 as well",0.0
So they do sort of make themselves out that as were even in the P&amp;L,0.0
"You’ve got the full amount coming through, but that prepayments sitting in the balance sheet starts to positively come through the P&amp;L",0.0
"
Glyn Lawcock
Yeah, but I mean the P&amp;L will show a much larger cost imposed then the 2",-0.2
5%,0.1
So I’m just trying to make sure I understand,0.0
"Once the prepayment is done, what sort of cost imposed is it roughly double",-0.2
So it’s more or like 2,0.0
"5% becomes 5%, and 5% become 10%, once the prepayment unwinds",0.0
Or I just want to make sure I understand how much of the prepayment is covering,0.0
"
Grant Dempsey
Well, I think…
Glyn Lawcock
What is the gross cost impact through the P&amp;L, which [you’ll feel] [ph] after the prepayment",-1.0
"
Grant Dempsey
Sure",0.1
"I think, we’ve got 5 years of the prepayment coming through, Glyn, so it’s still a while off",0.0
"And as I said when we get to that point, we do have quite a lot of spare capacity in terms of looking to re-contract some gas at the lower price",0.0
"So I think, looking 5 years out in terms of what the cost would be pretty difficult, because we actually think it’s – we are going to get some of lower cost options coming up in the next little while",-1.0
As we’re looking to potentially fill that gap,0.0
"So it’s – the cost for the next 5 years, is that net cost, just because that’s when the prepayment unwinds, and that’s where the contract largely impacts us",-0.2
"
Glyn Lawcock
Okay",-0.4
But just to be clear,0.0
"What would be the gross impact going through the P&amp;L then, because I mean that, we’ve got to try and forecast that as well",-1.0
"
Grant Dempsey
Yeah",0.2
"Well, I don’t have that number with me",0.0
"But again, that’s just to be clear, the actual amortization does actually go through the P&amp;L, so it does net off",0.0
"So you’re right – costs will be high, but the amortization comes out as a benefit",1.0
So it does net,0.0
Our COGS will actually be the net figure,0.0
"
Glyn Lawcock
Okay, I thought each unwind it off the balance sheet, all right, and just on costs, and you talked about caustic soda of plateauing now",0.8
But is there still some tailwind to come through,0.0
"I mean, what sort of tailwinds on cost can we expect into 2020",0.9
I can see the FX is a bit lower today,0.0
"But how much more caustic, do you think was yet to flow through given the lag on the inventory side",-1.0
"
Grant Dempsey
Yeah, I think a little bit still to come through, because it did step down, as you say, towards the back end of last year",0.0
So that will come through,0.0
"And the Australian dollars about the any other thing that really, we can see as giving some tailwinds to cost",0.7
Those 2 things will help in the first quarter,1.0
"As I said, probably offset a little bit by the seasonal maintenance we do in the first half",0.0
"
Glyn Lawcock
Can you quantify the caustic benefit, that’s left to come through, you think, if it plateaus from here",0.9
"
Grant Dempsey
No",0.1
Not really,-0.7
"
Glyn Lawcock
Okay",-0.4
Thanks,1.0
"
Grant Dempsey
Thank you",1.0
"
Operator
Thank you",1.0
And the next question we have is from the line of Paul McTaggart from Citigroup,0.0
You may now ask your question,0.0
"

Paul McTaggart
Good morning",1.0
"I just wanted to ask a topical question around Scope 3 emissions because, obviously, there’s a lot of noise around some of the [alum] [ph] majors looking to start reporting Scope 3 emissions in the future",-1.0
"Have you thought about that will you be reporting Scope 3, I’m just sort of trying to get a sense of how you see this playing out",-0.2
"
Michael Ferraro
We are in the process of working with Alcoa to work through what targets we’ll be working towards",0.0
"And that will include a discussion, obviously, what Scope 1 is clearly some of that has already reported already",0.0
"Scope 2 and 3, we do want to agree standards and targets with them, but that’s still a work in progress",0.7
"Hopefully, we can sort most, if not all of that out this calendar year",0.3
"
Paul McTaggart
Okay",-0.1
"Thanks, Mike",1.0
"
Michael Ferraro
You’re welcome",0.9
"
Operator
Thank you",1.0
Next question is from the line of Peter O’Connor from Shaw,0.0
Your line is now open,0.0
"
Peter O’Connor
Good morning, Mike, Grant",1.0
I have 3 questions,0.0
"Back to gas – again, sorry, Grant",-1.0
These more clarification questions or not,0.0
"So just to make sure, I’ve got this right",1.0
"So the gas price on a full year basis has gone up 5%, but given it’s only for half year this year it’s 2",-0.3
"5% over the full year, but 5% for 2021",0.0
Is that the way I should read it,0.4
"
Grant Dempsey
Yeah",0.2
"
Peter O’Connor
Got it",0.3
Okay,-0.8
"And in terms of what Glyn was asking, I’ll take that a bit further",0.0
"So I’m 5% increase in costs is, I don’t know, on a 2/10 base, what’s that, $11",0.0
And the amortization seems to be about $10 a tonne,0.0
So does that mean the underlying impact of the high gas cost is about $20,0.0
"
Grant Dempsey
I don’t think the amortization’s quite that high",0.0
"But again, we haven’t disclosed that, so I’m not sure I have those numbers in front of me",0.0
I’m happy to have a conversation about it,1.0
"But I think, as I said, given that these things will go on for 5 years, that amortization is going to be pretty similar for 5 years",0.1
The net figure for the next 5 years is pretty much the focus,0.0
"And by the time that finishes, we’ve got quite a lot of capacity open up to average down our energy costs is certainly the strategy at the moment",0.7
"
Peter O’Connor
Okay",0.2
That’s fine,1.0
"And Mike, Portland, any updates, any thoughts where that’s going",0.1
"And secondly, [LE] [ph] demand",0.0
"You made a comment, I don’t know I’m going to get it exactly right, but you talked about demand not being lost because of corona, but delayed or deferred",-1.0
Is that optimistic,0.5
"
Michael Ferraro
I’ll turn to Portland first",0.1
Portland positions are still very much as it was in prior discussions,0.0
"So that – we are still looking to identify an energy solution that works financially going forward, and that is still not yet identified",0.9
So I don’t really have any more update on that at the moment,0.0
"In the context of aluminium demand, what we’re seeing is that to start with China that smelters are still producing, because they can’t really afford at the moment to shut down and inventory is building",-0.7
"
Downstream manufacturers with finished products may not be taking the aluminum, so inventories are building up, whereas alumina capacity in China is floating upwards and downwards and reducing, I think, 7 million or 8 million tonnes have been taken out of the system, in China, because of inability to get inputs and also associated – the cost of the alumina",0.0
So what’s happening is more alumina is being exported into China from the rest of the world,0.0
"Now I see that as only a temporary phase, while smelting continues to build inventories, because they can afford to shut down",-0.1
"If the coronavirus continues then clearly some smelting capacity will shut down, because the demand won’t be there for the finished product",0.0
And that is a major impact – a significant issue,-0.6
"
In the context of the rest of the world, and maybe some upside in the short-term in the context of far lesser Chinese exports of semi-finished products leaving China to compete in other parts of the world such as the U",-0.1
S,-0.1
"and Europe, so domestic smelter manufacturers might be better off in that sense",0.8
But the downside for them is also that the end customer may not – the demand at the end customer level will fall,-0.9
"

So all-in-all, I think the longer term impact of the coronavirus if it continues similar to just about every other industry out there is not positive",-1.0
"
Peter O’Connor

Next question is from the line of Hayden Bairstow from Macquarie,0.0
Your line is now open,0.0
"
Hayden Bairstow
Hey, thanks, guys",1.0
Just a couple from me,0.0
"Just back to that Alcoa sort of restructuring work they’re doing, I mean, is there any sort of update on timing on some of the other assets in the AWAC portfolio that might be part of that review [sand debris] [ph] and those sorts of things",-0.1
"And just on the EBA in WA, I mean, there is good result in November last year",1.0
Can you just remind me how long that EBA now goes for,0.3
Thanks,1.0
"
Michael Ferraro
There is no further update on the AWAC assets and in the context of restructuring",-0.1
I suspect I’m not sure that Alcoa is probably focusing on some of the non-AWAC assets at the moment,-1.0
"As you saw recently, they sold off a waste disposal facility in the U",-1.0
S,-0.1
"In account – sorry, what was your second question",-1.0
"
Hayden Bairstow
Just the EBA in WA, which – pretty good result, but how long they go for until the next round of negotiations starting in",0.9
"
Michael Ferraro
I’m not sure",0.0
"Usually, they last for at least 3 years, occasionally 5",0.0
But I genuinely don’t know how long this one will last,0.0
"
Hayden Bairstow
Okay",-0.2
And just back to the Juruti potential mine move,0.0
"I mean, Alcoa and the [all of the other weight] [ph] was sort of saying that it basically starts towards the end of this year and rolls sort of 2021",-0.1
Are you saying that there is potential to delay that,-1.0
"
Grant Dempsey
There is just going to assessment now",0.3
"I think, yeah, the plans, if you go back 12 months, I think that was always the plan to follow up the crusher movement Willowdale with Juruti, but it is part of the assessment to be done",0.0
That decision hasn’t been made yet,0.0
"So it is an option to delay that and really just comes down to a whole lot of assessment as to the trade-off between CapEx and OpEx, and the right time to do it is",-1.0
"
Hayden Bairstow
Okay, great",1.0
"Thanks, guys",1.0

The next question we have is from the line of Kaan Peker from Jefferies",0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Kaan Peker
Just 2 quick follow-ups for me, please, if that’s okay",0.0
Just I think there was a mention on the tax dispute,-0.7
"Just want to get an understanding, just roughly around the quantum and, I suppose, the timing around that",0.0
"
And secondly, with the Point Comfort restructuring, with the holding charges, so that seems to be around sort of $10 million to $15 million",0.8
Should we sort of model that for the next 5-odd-years as well,0.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Grant Dempsey
I can answer the second question first",0.0
"So, yeah, it’s probably slightly higher than that",0.0
We’ve disclosed $55 million overall and I think about $38 million for the restructuring and the rest of it is holding costs,0.0
And that will hold itself out for the next few years,0.0
But then does decline over time,0.0
"So it probably starts declining actually a couple of million bucks a year from here on, until it hits to a low point in 5 or 6 years",-0.1
"
Kaan Peker
So for around $15 million or $20 million for the next couple of years will be…
Grant Dempsey
It’s probably at the lower end of that and then will decline",-0.3
It’s less than 2021 and 2022,0.0
It’s just keeps going down as the asset gets hold,0.4
"
Kaan Peker
Thanks",1.0
"
Michael Ferraro
On the ATO tax despite, the quantum as mentioned in our 4E is the ATO claims that there is a tax adjustment to be made of A$212 million",0.0
"At the moment, it’s going through an independent review process, which will start shortly within the ATO",0.0
"We’re not sure exactly when that will be finalized, but we would expect in the next few months",0.0
And then that will determine whether or not a tax assessment will be issued,0.0

You may now proceed with your question,0.0
"
Lyndon Fagan
Sorry, just a quick follow-up on all of the restructuring charges",-1.0
You’ve obviously given us one-year-out guidance,0.0
"But when we had Point Comfort, Suriname, Point Henry, how much is it each year for the next phase 3",0.9
Are you able to give us some color on just what the total cash out flow is over the coming years,0.0
"
Michael Ferraro
We haven’t really provided that information",-0.5
"I mean, it does decline",-0.1
"So next year – I think the view that we announced is that in the next 5 years, the majority of the restructuring cost for Point Comfort is going to be done and that is the significant majority",0.5
That is probably heavy in the next 2 years and then starts to tail off,-1.0
"
Lyndon Fagan
Okay, thanks",1.0

Operator
Thank you",1.0
And a follow-up question from the line of Peter O’Connor from Shaw,0.0
Your line is now open,0.0
"
Peter O’Connor
Grant, just on funding and the facility that you got in place, which is, I guess, handy to have the [224] [ph] as you mentioned",1.0
It seems a loss for what you got your plate and the delay in the WA growth plans and potentially Juruti as well,-1.0
"Given the facility charges et cetera with that is – are you comfortable holding that for the next 4/5 years, is that rate, or at that level, to cover any potential growth",0.9
"
Grant Dempsey
Yeah, it’s pretty efficient facility to be honest",1.0
"So, the costs are very low and it always gives us good comfort that we have a nice insurance policy if ever needed, but for some long-term opportunities really",1.0
It’s probably is more focused on the opportunity side in case it’s needed,0.0
"But, having said that, there are lots of different ways of funding those opportunities too, so it’s not necessarily using our facility",0.0
"
We do use it throughout the year too",0.0
"Obviously, there are dividends paid twice a year, which need to be funded",-0.7
That often come in different times in our distributions we have from AWAC,0.0
So it does go up and down throughout the year,0.0
But you’re right; it’s a decent insurance policy in that facility,0.9

8% increase in sales of 11% increased volumes and 5% average sales price increase,0.0
We also had a 10,0.0
5% increase in interest income,0.1
And we're very happy to see same-store revenues up 15,0.7
1%,0.1
Revenues from stores in over 10 years of age category was up 14%,-0.1
Stores in the 5- to 10-year category was up 19% and revenues for stores in the less than five years of age category was up about 47% to about $17 million,0.0

Our overall productivity was 30,0.0
"6 units per lot per month, up almost 10% from 27",0.0
9 compared to the prior year quarter,-0.1
"

Our 10-year-plus lots produced 33",0.1
1 units per month per lot for the quarter compared to 30,0.0
4 for the prior year quarter,0.0
Lots in the 5- to 10-year category produced 28,0.0
6 compared to 26,0.0
9,0.1
And the lots less than 5 years of age had productivity of 23,0.0
4 compared to 20,0.0
7 for the third quarter of last year,0.0
"
Our down payment percentage was basically flat compared to the prior year quarter",-0.1
And collections as a percentage of average finance receivables was flat at 13,-0.1
"2%, but up on a relative basis due to the increase in term",0.0
Our term increase was primarily due to the increasing average selling price of the car,0.0
The average originating contract term for the quarter was 30,-0.4
8 months compared to 29,-0.1
4 for the prior year quarter and up from 30,0.0

3% compared to 41,0.0
5% for the prior year quarter and down just slightly from the sequential quarter,-0.1
"Again, the average selling price increased $604 over the prior year quarter and gross margin percentages are lower at higher selling prices",-0.1
"
The majority of this selling price increase relates to the overall strength of the used car values in our market and a continuing effort to buy high-quality vehicle",0.9
We did see a slight increase in the number of SUVs sold over the prior year quarter,0.0
We have increased our quality and our selection of vehicles to meet customers' needs during the upcoming tax refund season with an additional $6 million investment in inventory most of which relates to increased quantities,0.1
"
With these increased investments in inventory both volume and quality it's essential that we stay very efficient in our operational processes",1.0

"8 million, 18",0.0
66% of sales compared to 18,-0.2

9% of total revenues less cost of sales and provision for credit losses compared to 60,-1.0
5% for the prior year quarter,0.0
"
Most of the increase is due to payroll costs for additional associate count as well as continued investments in pay benefits and training",0.0
"The current quarter did have approximately $357,000 of additional stock compensation expense compared to the prior year quarter",-0.4
"
These investments are being made to ensure that we can service a growing customer base at the highest level and earn their repeat business",0.0
"We believe the investments that we're making in our associates, our system and the infrastructure are essential to continuing operational improvements and being prepared to take care of our customers",1.0
"
We added over 5,100 customers since this time last year and over 1,300 this quarter",0.0
We'll always continue to stay focused on efficiencies and cost control while continuing to invest for the long-term,0.2
"
For the current quarter net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables was 5",-0.2
9% down from 6,-0.1
2% in the prior year third quarter,-0.1
"We continue to see improvement in both the frequency and the severity of losses compared to the prior year as a result of a higher quality vehicle, improved deal structures and our focus on the operational non-negotiables related to collection",-0.9
"

Recovery rates for the quarter were slightly lower than the third quarter of 2019 and approximately flat compared to the sequential quarter",-0.5
Our effective income tax rate was 19% for the third quarter compared to 23,-0.1
7% for the prior year quarter,0.0
"The income tax expense did include an income tax benefit of $922,000 and $41,000 related to share-based compensation for the current quarter and the prior year quarter, respectively or about $0",-0.7
13 per diluted share,0.0
"
We expect our base effective tax rate to be approximately 24% going forward prior to any excess tax benefits from stock option exercises",-0.4

Thank you and I'll turn it back to Jeff now",1.0

Jeff Williams
Okay",0.1
"Thank you, Vickie",1.0
"As you saw in the press release, we are close to finishing our Taylor Motors acquisition and we'll be opening our Cabot, Arkansas dealership during the fourth quarter",0.0
This will give us six new dealerships for fiscal 2020,0.0
"We are progressing on our new dealership locations in Edmond, Oklahoma and in Chattanooga, Tennessee",0.3
"
And we recently signed a lease for a new location in Norman, Oklahoma",0.0
"New dealership openings will be part of our growth plan going forward and we're also open to other opportunities, like the Taylor Motors opportunity, as we move forward",0.7
"As we've said over the last few years, most of our existing general managers have the ability and are in towns and locations that have the potential to serve 1,000 customers or more over time",0.0
We will continue to look to leverage that opportunity,0.1
"
We have such a strong culture and our associates give 100% every day to help each other and to help our customers succeed",0.7
There is real purpose in our work and we're very proud of the difference we're making and we're very excited to be in a position to expand what we do to more customers,1.0
"And lastly, thank you to all of our hardworking, passionate associates who come to work every day to make a difference",1.0

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you",1.0
"At this time, participants will now answer questions from the callers",0.0
"I would like to reiterate that my earlier comments regarding forward-looking statements apply, both to the participants' prepared remarks and to anything that may come up during the Q&amp;A",0.8
[Operator Instructions] Our first question in comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Yarden Amsalem
Good morning, guys",1.0
This is Yarden Amsalem for John,0.1
"
Vickie Judy
Good morning",1.0
"
Yarden Amsalem
So, first question -- good morning -- on your top line what would you attribute the very strong same-store sales increase to",1.0
"I mean, can you maybe point to the key one or two factors",0.0
And would you say it was more driven by our newest store or they are more legacy stores,0.0
"
Jeff Williams
I would say it's a combination of things",0.0
It starts with inventory,0.0
We're doing a better job with inventory procurement,1.0
We're carrying more cars better quality cars,1.0
We've also spent a lot of time training our field sales reps,0.0
"So it's an investment in training, its inventory",0.0
"

Our digital efforts online are also contributing to the sales improvements",0.2
"And I would say, it's pretty much across the board as far as volume improvements and productivity improvements",0.6
"All of our dealerships are seeing more traffic, more interest and we're closing more sales",0.2
"
Yarden Amsalem
Thank you",1.0
"So, just to follow-up on that, you've recently talked about your investment in digital platform and online capabilities and marketing",0.0
Can you maybe share more color on these efforts and what kind of traction are you getting from your consumers,0.2
"
Jeff Williams
Well, we've had our online credit application in place, just beginning this fiscal year",0.6
And we're getting a lot of traffic online,0.0
We're getting a lot of applications online,0.1
And we're doing a fair job of converting those applications to physical visits to the dealerships,0.9
"
And then, the close rate for those sales is pretty high",0.2
"So we're really fairly new into that effort at this point, but we're optimistic that over time we're going to be -- we're good now, but we're going to get better, as far as our digital efforts",1.0
But they certainly have increased our traffic and we've seen some good results so far,0.5
"
Vickie Judy
We've also just tried to have a bigger and a better presence on just several of the social media channels with customer reviews and customer testimonials",0.9
"And, I think, some of that Google reviews and that type of thing",0.0
And I think that's helped some as well,1.0
"
Yarden Amsalem
Excellent",1.0
Thank you,1.0
"And I guess lastly, how should we think about gross margins for the new vehicles going forward",0.0
I know like the deterioration of this is partly driven by higher average selling prices,-0.8
But I'm just curious to hear if you guys think it should keep coming under pressure next year,0.0
Or maybe can you ever go back towards the 42% level,0.0
"
Vickie Judy
Yeah",0.3
The 42% level probably becomes a bit of a challenge,0.1
I don't think we'll see that big of a change to get back to that percentage with the used vehicle market where it's at especially with the quality that we're trying to carry and the increased demand for the SUVs and trucks there also,-0.1
"So, I think there'll continue to be some pressure there",0.0
I think there will continue to be some pressure there as we try to expand our customer experience and step into some different areas there,0.0
So,-0.2
"
Jeff Williams
We do have some room to continue to look at productivity improvements and efficiencies in the field in the repair cost",0.6
There are things that we're working on to maintain those gross profit percentages,0.0
"But the dollar gross margin is going up, but the percentage is a little more of a challenge",0.2
"But we know that, and we're trying to do all we can to keep that gross margin percentage up",0.0
"
Yarden Amsalem
Yeah",0.2
Okay,-0.8
Thank you very much,1.0
That’s it for me,0.0
"
Jeff Williams
Thank you",1.0
"
Operator
Thank you",1.0
And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Joseph with Jefferies,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Kyle Joseph
Hey",0.1
"Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question",1.0
"
Vickie Judy
Good morning, Kyle",1.0
"
Kyle Joseph
I just wanted to pick your brain on the competitive environment",0.1
"Obviously given your same-store sales trends we can kind of surmise, what's going on in the competitive environment",0.0
Just -- but just wanted to hear what you guys are seeing there,0.1
"
Vickie Judy
Competition is still very strong",0.2
I don't think that we've seen any decrease there,0.0
But what we're trying to do is make sure we've got the quality vehicle,0.0
"And then we're trying to stress our value, and what we offer compared to our competitors out there",-1.0
Just trying to get better in what we're doing,1.0
"
Jeff Williams
Yeah",0.2
"And we do emphasize our lower interest rate, our shorter term, the total cost of ownership with Car-Mart, and then the peace of mind that's so important to the quality of lives of our customers",0.9
"When you put all that together, what we offer is superior to other offerings in the market",1.0
But there are a lot of other offerings in the market and competition is very high,0.0
"But we're doing good in a market just, because of our efforts to really block and tackle run the play and treat these customers at the highest level",1.0
"

Kyle Joseph
Got it",0.4
"And then given that we're in February now, could you guys give us a sense for expectations for tax refunds this year in terms of size and timing",-0.1
"
Vickie Judy
Yeah",0.3
So the timing has been pushed back a little bit again this year,0.0
Refunds actually haven't started -- been released yet,-0.8
"So, it will probably all going to happen here in just a very short period of time",-0.8
"
Kyle Joseph
Got it",0.4
Okay,-0.8
And then just lastly in terms of credit obviously things have been stable in terms of your down payments and collections,-0.9
"But going forward with the revamped growth here, can you give us kind of your outlook for both charge-offs as well as the provision going forward, and any impact the sort of renewed new growth would have there",1.0
"
Vickie Judy
Yeah",0.3
"So, of course with the increased selling price and the term going out a little bit, the severity becomes a little bit stressed when you do take something back, and then if process change in your FMVs and that puts some pressure there as well",-1.0
"So, we're going to be focused on the customer experience and making sure that we keep our frequency of the units that we're repossessing down and that we're taking care of all of those customers",1.0
But there will certainly be some pressure from the severity side as we move forward,0.0
"
Jeff Williams
But we are convinced that we're putting a better product out higher quality car and that our service levels have improved immensely and our collections efforts are solid and strong",1.0
And we expect continuing good improvements that results in the credit loss line as we go forward even with the increased volumes,0.5
"
Vickie Judy
Yes, our underwriting is very solid",0.0
"We feel like, we've kept a good handle on our underwriting there",1.0
"
Kyle Joseph
Got it",0.4
That’s it for me,0.0
Thanks very much for answer my questions,1.0
"
Jeff Williams
Thank you",1.0
"
Operator
Thank you",1.0
And our next question comes from Vincent Caintic with Stephens,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Vincent Caintic
Thank you",1.0
Good morning,1.0
I wanted to touch on two things,0.0
"So, following up on Kyle's question on the competition",0.1
"Just we've heard from some other lenders like for example Credit Acceptance who are kind of facing maybe difficulties from the competitive environment, but nice to see that you've been growing quite well",1.0
When you've -- I guess your growth has it been -- have you seen market share that you're taking,0.9
Is it more of kind of just addressing customers that weren't served before,-0.2
Sort of what's the environment there in terms of maybe addressing new opportunities versus taking share,-0.3
"
Jeff Williams
I just -- I think we've done a good job again with our digital efforts as Vickie mentioned in the -- on the advertising side and in the brand reputation and the community involvement",1.0
"And then, when you combine that with more cars and a broader mix of cars and nicer cars on the dealership and then you educate our associates and the communities on the true cost of ownership, our transaction looks more and more appealing to customers that have choices in the market",1.0
"
And what's nice about our model is we've added about three units per month on the sales side",0.9
"And so it's -- in each community, it's hard to know exactly where those three units of market share came from",-1.0
"But I think, it's a combination of all the good things we're doing",1.0
And we're convinced that we have more room to educate the market about the true value proposition that we put out there and the peace of mind we give customers in helping them keep those cars on the road,1.0
"So, it's a combination of things",0.0
"But the market is very competitive, but I think the good work that we're doing is obviously more than offsetting the competitive pressures",1.0
"
Vincent Caintic
Okay, great",1.0
"Used car prices, what are you seeing there",0.3
Have you been getting some benefit there,0.8
Or is it -- are you still seeing some pressure from higher used car prices,0.0
Thank you,1.0
"

Vickie Judy
It's -- there's really been not a lot of change recently",0.0
We're trying to expand some of the markets that we're buying in and looking at different purchasing options,0.0
But we really haven't seen a big change in the cost of the cars we're buying,-0.8
"This time a car around -- or this time of the year around tax time is generally higher anyway, but not a big change",-0.4
"
Vincent Caintic
Okay",-0.4
And maybe just one more from me,0.0
The initiative for keeping cars on the road just kind of wondering how that rollout has gone and if there's more work that needs to be done or any more investments that need to be done,0.1
Thank you,1.0
"
Jeff Williams
We continue to look for creative value-added ways to help our customers stay on the road and keep those cars in good operating shape",0.3
"So, we continue to work on things that are going to set us apart from the competition even more than we have already",0.0
"And anything that we come up with will be directed at that consumer, helping that consumer out, keeping them in the car, keeping their car on the road",0.3
And we feel like we've got to the room to continue to look for creative ways to improve our already outstanding offer,1.0
"
Vincent Caintic 
Okay, great",1.0
Thanks very much,1.0
"
Jeff Williams
Thank you",1.0
"
Operator
Thank you",1.0
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Rowan with Janney,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
John Rowan
Good morning",1.0
"
Vickie Judy
Good morning",1.0
"
John Rowan
Vickie you mentioned increased loss severity a couple of questions ago",-0.2
I didn't get down why there's increased loss severity,-1.0
Is that just around used car pricing pushing up your -- the cost of the cars or is it a duration issue,-0.5
What's driving that,0.1
"
Vickie Judy
Yeah",0.3
So currently we are still seeing a decrease in the severity,0.0
"So we -- quarter-over-quarter here recently, we've seen decreases in both frequency and severity",0.0
But as we look forward and our selling price continues to rise or we sell more of these higher quality or the mix of SUVs and more and if that sales price continues to rise that does put pressure on that severity,0.0
"
John Rowan
Okay",0.1
And then you also talked about tax refund season,0.0
"And I guess just to dig in a little bit more, we've obviously seen some of the initial data coming out of the IRS",0.0
But I mean last year there was a policy shift around earned income tax credit and the additional child care tax credits that really pushed around significantly the timing of tax refunds,0.6
Are you aware of any similar change in IRS policy that would have a structural shift in the timing of certain large tax refund cohorts similar to what happened last year,-0.1
"
Vickie Judy
No -- and our customers were largely unaffected last year too",0.0
"I mean, they actually got back a little more last year and we're expecting about the same type of refunds this year as they got last year",0.0
So no real changes this year other than just the timing has been pushed out a little bit,-0.5
"
John Rowan
Okay",0.1
Thank you,1.0

Jeff Williams
Thank you",1.0
"
Operator
Thank you",1.0
And I'm not showing any further questions at this time,-0.1

In addition, secular growth trends are fueling broad-based momentum across our target markets",0.2
"And third, we are monitoring the coronavirus situation and want to acknowledge those who have been affected",-0.1
"While we do see some potential for near-term impact, we remain confident in the strength of our broad portfolio of industry-focused solutions, software and services",0.8
"
Now, let's take a deeper look into our first quarter",0.3
We achieved $1,0.4
"26 in earnings per share, which was $0",0.0
16 above the high end of our guidance and represents 36% year-over-year earnings growth,0.4
"We achieved record first quarter orders that grew 12% year-over-year, reflecting the resilience of our business and extensive market reach",0.1
Revenue grew 9% year-over-year to reach a new first quarter record,0.0
"First quarter revenue performance was driven by strength in Commercial Communications, Aerospace, Defense and Government, and Semiconductor Measurement Solutions",0.1
"
In commercial communications, record first quarter revenue was driven by continued investments in 5G, fueled by the transformation of communications systems, including wireless access, infrastructure, wireline technologies, data center and the cloud",0.0
Our success is being driven by close collaboration with key market players to innovate and create many industry firsts,0.2
"
For example, we recently introduced the Value Series Channel Emulation Solution called PROPSIM FS16",0.4
This solution was enabled by the Anite acquisition and is the latest in a long line of our innovative first-to-market solutions to accelerate 5G development and commercialization,0.1
"
We’re also excited to announce today another industry-first solution that enables customers to model 5G security threats in the lab",-0.7
"5G technology innovation is enabling a massive proliferation of connected devices resulted in greater security, vulnerabilities, and an expanded attack surface",-0.7
Keysight's 5G security testbed was made possible by the cybersecurity expertise and technology gained through the Ixia acquisition,0.4
"
Recall, that as of the first quarter, we integrated the Ixia Solutions Group, ISG, into our Communication Solutions Group to accelerate solution synergies and the teams are already getting very good traction",1.0
"For the second consecutive quarter, orders for Ixia Solutions grew double-digits as we saw continued strength in network visibility and 400-gigabit Ethernet investment in Layer 2/3 protocol solutions",0.3
"
Ixia and our other commercial communications acquisitions such as Anite, AT4 and PRISMA enable us to provide our customers with a broad and differentiated set of solutions that span the stack layers as 5G evolves over the years to come",0.1
We are pleased with the broad global adoption of our 5G platform as our R&amp;D solutions continue to lead the industry,1.0
"
For example, we recently announced that Keysight's 5G conformance test solutions have been selected by the Korea testing laboratory for global 5G device certification",0.0
We are also seeing success beyond R&amp;D with key wins this quarter in component manufacturing for base stations and devices as 5G production begins to ramp globally,0.9
"
Moving on to other growth factors, our strong performance beyond commercial communications reinforces our broad momentum across Keysight's diverse end markets",0.5
"In Aerospace Defense and Government, our revenue grew double digits to achieve a first quarter record with broad base strength across all regions",0.1
This was the third consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year order growth in Aerospace Defense,0.4
"
Our solutions for electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar, space and satellite continue to benefit from a favorable U",0.9
S,-0.1
spending environment and ongoing investments in technology modernization,0.5
"In automotive and energy, revenue grew high single digits with increasing customer demand for key strategic applications",0.0
"

Our success in automotive is being driven by our first-to-market solutions and focus on next-generation technologies",0.1
"For example, this quarter we achieved 3GPP validation of the industry's first C-V2X or cellular vehicle-to-everything radio frequency conformance test case",0.0
"
As a result, Keysight is enabling the automotive industry to accelerate commercialization of connected cars and autonomous vehicles",0.0
We also announced a collaboration with a leading provider of battery cells on cell formation,0.0
This collaboration supports the electrification of vehicles by enabling the development and manufacture of advanced battery cells,0.5
"
In Semiconductor Measurement Solutions, we achieved strong order and revenue growth driven by our customer strategic investments in next-generation process readiness",0.4
Our software and services continue to play an increasingly important role in Keysight's differentiated portfolio of customer-centric solutions,0.1
"
Software orders once again grew above our overall growth rate",1.0
"Notably, this quarter, Keysight was named the organizational winner of the 2020 Business Intelligence Group Award for our PathWave Test 2020 software released just last October",0.1
PathWave Test 2020 was selected from a range of recent innovations submitted by organizations around the globe,0.0
I'm also happy to report that services orders and revenue grew double-digits in the quarter,0.1
"We continue to see good adoption of our new support offerings such as Keysight Care, which was also a contributor to our year-over-year gross margin expansion",1.0
"
In summary, we delivered another outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year",1.0
"Differentiated solutions across diverse end markets, consistent execution, and strong financial performance continue to drive our value creation",0.1
We have an exciting lineup for you at our Investor Day next week on March 3 and we look forward to sharing an update on our strategy and our long-term expectations to the business,1.0
"
Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail",0.6
"
Neil Dougherty
Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone",1.0
"Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise",-0.1
We delivered another strong quarter as we continue to capitalize on the broad-based momentum across Keysight's diverse end markets,0.1
"For the first quarter of 2020, we delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1",0.0
"095 billion, which was well above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8% on a core basis",1.0
"
Better than expected revenue results were driven by broad strength across multiple end markets",1.0
Orders outpaced revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter as Q1 orders of $1,0.0
141 billion grew 12% in total and 11% on a core basis,0.0
"Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported record gross margin of 65% and our operating expenses of $433 million, resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter with operating margin at or above 25%",0.0
We also achieved net income of $240 million and delivered $1,0.0
"26 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our guidance",1.0
"
Now, moving to the performance of our segments",0.5
"Our Communications Solutions Group generated total revenue of $818 million, up 9% while delivering record gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 25%",0.0
"In Q1, Commercial Communications delivered double-digit order growth and revenue of $573 million, driven by strength in 5G solutions",0.1
"
As Ron mentioned earlier, starting in the first quarter, we have aligned the former Ixia Solutions Group or ISG with our commercial communications end market and are now reporting Ixia results within our Communications Solutions Group",0.1
"
Aerospace Defense and Government generated revenue of $245 million, an increase of 10% and a first quarter record driven by a broad-based growth across all regions as investment in advanced technology continued",0.0
Order growth for this end market was high-single digits and we have a strong funnel going into Q2,0.1
"

EISG generated first quarter revenue of $277 million, up 8% driven by strength in semiconductor measurement and next-gen automotive solutions",0.0
EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 26%,-0.2
"
Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow, we enter our first quarter with $1",0.0
69 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $197 million and free cash flow of $165 million or 15% of revenue,0.4
"Under our share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 730,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $102",0.0
48 for a total consideration of $75 million,0.0
"
Now, turning to our outlook and guidance",0.4
We expect second quarter 2020 revenue to be in the range of $1,0.0
138 billion to $1,0.0
178 billion,0.0
"For the first half of 2020, the midpoint of our guidance reflects 7% revenue growth or 6% core growth",0.5
This guidance incorporates our current assessment of the coronavirus impact,0.1
"
Given the dynamics of the situation, we expect any impact from coronavirus to simply be a push-out in demand and do not anticipate any impact on our full-year results at this time",-0.2
We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1,0.0
28 to $1,0.1
38 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares,0.0
The midpoint of this guidance reflects approximately 20% earnings growth for the first half of 2020,0.3
"
As Ron mentioned, we look forward to sharing our strategy to drive profitable growth, as well as our latest long-term expectations for the business at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3",0.9
"
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&amp;A",0.0

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse",0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
John Pitzer
Yes",0.0
"Good afternoon, Ron and Neil",1.0
Congratulations on the solid results,0.5
"Neil, I know you said in your prepared comments that the guidance for the fiscal second quarter includes your view of the coronavirus impact",0.0
I'm just wondering if you can quantify it for us a little bit – for us,0.0
Did it bring down the midpoint,0.0
Did it widen the range,0.0
"And I guess, how are you thinking about kind of your exposure",0.0
Is it mainly a function of what you're shipping into China or if you can just walk through the methodology that would be helpful,1.0
"
Ron Nersesian
Yes",0.1
"Hi, John",0.0
This is Ron,0.2
I'm going to give you a little bit of a long answer on this because I figure there's a lot of interest in the effects of the coronavirus,0.5
"First of all, it's a very unfortunate situation affecting not only China, but we're seeing it obviously in South Korea, Italy, and other countries, including customers around the world",-1.0
"The situation is changing, so here is an up-to-the-minute update, as far as what we know at this point",-0.1
"
The first thing I'd like to say is that we have a lot of sales in China, but we do not do much manufacturing at all",1.0
Over 99% of our products are not manufactured in China,0.0
"We do receive about 10% of our parts or a little bit less than 10% of our parts from China, but all of this is built into what our guide is",0.0
"
So, let's talk about our employees",0.0
"We have 991 people in China and another about 233 non-Keysight workers that help us in sales, support, and research and development",0.8
"Of those 1,224 workers, luckily none have reported coronavirus cases at all",-0.9
"The other thing that's worthwhile to note is, if you look at Hubei province in Wuhan, they're not a big employment center for us",-0.9
"We have folks in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu in Szechwan Province and Shenzhen primarily, as well as some salespeople that are scattered throughout the rest of China",0.0
"
One third of those people are back at work already as we've opened up offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Shenzhen and the rest, the other 770 folks are working remotely through video conferences, remote support with remote control of instruments and giving daily reports to the sales management",0.4
"So, we get a daily report on the health status of every one, the sales funnel and how everybody is doing in order to make sure we're taking care of our customers, as well as our employees",1.0
"

We're working through that same process in other parts of the field or in other regions, but clearly the impact in other regions is smaller and not as big of a center for us",-0.1
"So, let's talk about the business implications as we know it",0.0
"Last quarter, we guided [$1",0.0
055 billion] in revenue and we delivered [$1,0.0
141 billion] in orders or we delivered $86 million in orders above what we said assuming a book to bill of 1%,-0.1
"
Of that $86 million in orders, we shipped $40 million of it",0.0
So we actually delivered revenue of $1,0.0
"095 billion, not $1",-0.5
"055 billion, but the additional $46 million we have in backlog that can help smooth out any timing delays that we would see from the coronavirus",-0.6
"
We have guided $1",0.1
"158 billion, plus or minus $20 million, and we've built in approximately $20 million worth of impact into our guide",0.0
The key point though that you should remember is that we have a good backlog situation,0.6
"We have very differentiated products, and we're very confident at this point that we'll be able to make up any delays that we see in the second half of the year, therefore not affecting Keysight's performance in fiscal year 2020",-0.6
"I hope that helps, John",1.0
"
John Pitzer
Very thorough – very thorough and helpful, Ron",1.0
"I guess, as my follow up, second consecutive strong quarter for Ixia",0.0
It's a relatively new business within your portfolio,0.0
"For us in the investment community, we haven't had a lot of experience with the Ixia asset",0.7
I'm just kind of curious as to how you would characterize sustainability of the growth you're seeing now,0.9
Is this in your mind a naturally lumpy business or do you feel like Ixia has kind of turned the corner and there's sustainability to these [terms],-1.0
"
Ron Nersesian
There's two main parts of the Ixia – what was the Ixia business, which is now our network assurance solutions, one of them is network test and then the other section is network visibility",0.3
Network visibility is a consistent grower,0.0
"It was smaller, but it continues to get larger and larger, and we're very happy with that",1.0
And there we see a little bit more of a linear growth,0.8
The network test business isn't as linear; it depends on basically the build-outs that happen in our end customers,-0.1
"
I'll turn it over to Satish to maybe add a couple of more comments, but that's the high level summary",0.0
"
Satish Dhanasekaran
Yes",0.0
Thanks Ron,1.0
I'll just say that the improved performance is a function of a few factors,0.7
"First, it's improving market dynamics associated with the broader adoption of 400-gig Ethernet, technologies from data centers, and then solid execution both on the business and the sales side through the changes that we have just instituted",0.5
"
The differentiated products and solutions that are coming out are gaining good traction with customers",1.0
"On the visibility side, as Ron mentioned with network packet brokers and taps and on the test side with our [Layer 2/3 business], which is a big part of that portfolio which had a record quarter through the broad adoption of the 400-gig technologies",0.0
"
Looking ahead, we're really focused on accelerating synergies inside the group",0.0
"As we've talked about, 5G is a big trend that impacts both wireless and wire line technologies and that convergence is really a sweet spot that we're targeting",0.9
"We have started some new solution offerings in the space, for example, with the combination of RAM and co-testing, we are very uniquely positioned there",0.4
"And second, we've recently launched the security testbed for 5G that does reference to Ron's transcript, which is really a combination of Ixia security toolkit and applied to the 5G technologies, which is gaining a lot of interest from customers",1.0
"
So, in summary, improving market dynamics, solid execution combined with this synergy utilization should position us well in this business",0.9
Thank you,1.0
"

Ron Nersesian
The other thing I would like to say is that obviously with the second quarter of double-digit growth, we're very happy with the way this business is progressing",1.0
"At first, we had to do a lot more integration work than we thought",0.1
We had to move the supply chain to ours to get basically the improvements and the synergies that we expected on the cost side and we had to enhance the quality,0.8
"
So that took a little bit more time than we had expected originally",0.0
"However, the business and the business dynamics and where it's going in the synergies that we have really makes us excited about this business' contribution to Keysight in the long-term and our ability to provide complete workflow solutions from one end to the other",0.5
"
John Pitzer
Thank you",1.0
"
Operator
Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies",0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Brandon Couillard
Thanks",1.0
Good afternoon,1.0
"
Ron Nersesian
Hi, Brandon",0.0
"
Brandon Couillard
Ron, Europe – and the European region kind of grew 2%, slowest on a two-year stack in about a year",-1.0
Can you sort of give us sort of macro picture maybe what you've seen in terms of the sub-segments in that region,0.0
"
Ron Nersesian
Sure",0.1
I'm going to turn it over to Mark,0.0
"Our order growth was higher than the 2% than we reported, and revenue was roughly 5% growth",0.5
"So, that's a little bit of a different picture, but Mark, the Head of Sales, will take you further",0.0
"
Mark Wallace
Right",0.5
"So, Brandon, we have seen gradually improving business conditions across Europe",0.9
"And as Ron said, revenue up 4%, 5% on orders, and we're seeing some of that come from the commercial comps side of our business",0.0
"Automotive, especially advanced automotive solutions and next-generation auto and semiconductor continue to show signs of recovery",0.1
"Aerospace Defense is mixed, the situation in Russia remains slow and there are some delays to some of those orders",-1.0
"
On the other side, general electronics is an area that we put a lot of focus on not only in Europe but around the world, both from our broad portfolio of customers, as well as our education customers and we continue to see growth there as well",0.9
"And then finally, the automotive business, particularly around electric vehicle, continues to expand with new customers and a strong funnel of new opportunities going forward",0.0
"
Some of these customers are more traditional automotive mechanical type of customers that are now moving into the electronics domain, and we are very well-positioned to support them with our solutions from Scienlab, as well as our broader offering of services",1.0
"So, we're seeing improving conditions as compared to kind of the middle of last year and we hope to see that continue going forward",1.0
"
Brandon Couillard
Thanks",1.0
"And a follow-up for Neil, 65% gross margin in the first quarter is a step up from the kind of where you exited the year last year; can you sort of speak to the room to continue to push that higher and perhaps help us bridge the year-over-year gross margin expansion in terms of the factors and drivers behind that",0.7
Thanks,1.0
"
Mark Wallace
I think we have multiple levers that are helping us on the gross margin line",1.0
"First of all, I pointed the overall strategy to migrate towards first-to-market solutions to that first-to-market nature, as well as just the nature of providing complete solutions as opposed to tools leads to higher differentiation in the marketplace of the solutions and to have higher software content",0.1
"
So, mix is helping us not only in terms of the mix of software, but the continued mix shift toward winning in R&amp;D tends to be a higher gross margin sale as well",0.8
"And notably, this quarter, we actually saw a pretty strong improvement in our services gross margins that it's a smaller business",0.8
"It does have below-average gross margin in total, but we saw nice improvement in our services business",1.0
"I think you see the migration toward Keysight Care, which is our new pay-for support or offering is being – is additive there as well",1.0
"

Brandon Couillard
Okay",-0.2
Thank you,1.0

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Marchetti from Stifel",0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Ron Nersesian
Hi, John",0.0
"
John Marchetti
Sorry about that",-1.0
"I just wanted to ask, Ron, you talked about obviously the 5G strength globally",0.1
"And just curious if you can characterize that, is there still a fair number of new customers that you're winning in that business",1.0
Is it the strengthening or reordering by existing customers,0.0
"Just curious as you're looking at that business continuing to sort of gain momentum, how we should think about the customer profile within it",0.9
"
Ron Nersesian
Yes",0.1
"Satish will take you through that, but I'm really pleased with the breadth of our overall customer base as it starts to go from Tier 1 to other players",1.0
And he'll talk about that,0.0
"
Satish Dhanasekaran
Yes",0.0
"Thanks, Ron",1.0
Very pleased with the results on 5G,1.0
I would say a new record as we indicated and growth across all regions and representing customers across this diverse set of ecosystems,0.7
"The collaborations that we have sustained through years of work with them continue to be very strong and a foundation for the business, but we're also adding new customers as 5G scale",0.1
"So this quarter, we added 40-plus new customers into our 5G platform, which has been a source of strength",0.7
"
One particular driver that I like to maybe point out that is – that'll play out to this year and the remaining part of this year is the adoption of number of devices that are being announced for 5G",0.0
Over 200 devices have been announced to-date,0.0
That is up 100% since August of 2019 when we last spoke about this,0.0
So that is a big driver for the ecosystem and that will continue to place as well,0.0
"
And finally, from an application point of view, we continue to be strong in R&amp;D where our differentiation is increasing through the test coverage and the new features we're landing, but we're also starting to pick up wins in manufacturing as we have stated we're following our customers' lifecycle",0.9
And we've had some pretty decent wins in manufacturing for components in base stations this quarter as well,1.0
"
John Marchetti
And maybe as a follow-up to that, I mean, historically you guys have talked about wanting to make sure you're really in cast where there's a high cost of failure",-1.0
"And as you're looking at some of the production opportunities within 5G, does that still fit that category",0.0
Is it that this is such a complicated technology for OEMs and operators to roll out that that cost of failure is still higher,-1.0
Is it a little bit of a change in strategy to try to broaden out the reach within 5G,0.0
Thank you,1.0
"
Ron Nersesian
There is plenty of manufacturing opportunities for us in 5G",0.0
"There is no doubt that our R&amp;D presence has grown and has grown dramatically, and that really plays well to our business model, but there are a high value-add opportunities for us in manufacturing",1.0
"Whether you see that with components or subassemblies, or you look at it down even on the wired part of 5G, you can't just put in wireless 5G and not be able to handle the data on the wired side",0.0
"
So when you look at everything from fiber optic tools and going all the way through the network, there is more and more opportunities for us especially you'll see that on the physical layer, on the physical layer back in the network",0.0
"On top of that, as everything moves to millimeter-wave, it gets more complex, more difficult to do, and that's where we've been playing for many, many decades and it's relatively new to most of our competitors",-1.0
"
So that provides us an opportunity not only to focus on areas where the cost of failure is high, but really we focus on where we can add value-add in total and generate great margins for us",-1.0
"
John Marchetti
Thank you",1.0
"
Ron Nersesian
Thanks, John",1.0

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG",0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Mehdi Hosseini
Yes",0.1
Thanks for taking my question,1.0
"Ron, a couple of quarters ago, you tried to take some of the revenue opportunity associated with Huawei, and there was like a 200 basis point to 500 basis point of the first half of the revenue target that was taken off to de-risk from Huawei, especially with the tariffs",-1.0
"And now we have the coronavirus, but what I want to learn is, assuming that this is more of push out, what happens when like 6, 9, 12 months from now coronavirus is over and hopefully the tariff is over",0.2
Can you help us understand what happens to these opportunities – revenue opportunities that are pushed out,0.9
And I have a follow up,0.0
"
Ron Nersesian
Yes",0.1
"I'll start and I'm going to let Neil go ahead and quantify the Huawei situation, but I'll just say this, the Huawei customers really like our products and solutions and they come to us and there's a good demand for those products",1.0
"As we look further in the year, we have a modest amount in our forecast, but for the long-term they're looking to lead in many markets and we have the differentiated tools to help them out",1.0
"
Neil Dougherty
I think that's right",0.9
"I think the same is largely to a broader coronavirus, as I said in my comments, we believe that any disruption that we may see in the short-term that results from coronavirus would simply be a push-out in demand",-0.4
We don't believe it has an ultimate impact on the absolute level of demand in this fiscal year,0.0
"I think if you look at Huawei more specifically, we saw broad strength within the quarter",0.6
"
We are limited in terms of what we can sell to Huawei, we're complying with the Department of Commerce regulations, but even with that limited portfolio, our sales to Huawei in the first quarter were a bit ahead of where we expected them to be",-0.3
"I think as we look forward, however we're pretty comfortable with the estimate that we provided of thinking of Huawei as a 1% to 2% customer as we move forward from here",1.0
"
Mehdi Hosseini
Okay",-0.4
"And then, I know you're going to dive into this next week, but as we think about your incremental booking, how much of this is driven by your ability to offer full of stack",0.0
Are you actually seeing any traction there,0.0
Is there any incremental business you're capturing by offering full stack or is that more of a longer-term target,0.0
"
Satish Dhanasekaran
Yes",0.0
"No – this is Satish here, and I'll just maybe offer a follow-through",0.0
"Yes, I think the ability to serve the entire ecosystem is a huge differentiator for us",0.0
It separates us from any product-oriented competition that may come up with products,0.0
I'd give you an example,0.0
"In many cases, we're working with operators",0.0
We just announced recently that we released 600 test scripts for the four U,0.0
S,-0.1
operator test plans for 5G,0.0
"
So, someone that wants to service these operators in that ecosystem now have a fastest way of ramping up and getting their time-to-market",1.0
"So, that's an example of sort of the advantage you get when you are working with somebody that has the end-to-end portfolio",0.8
"
Our ability to reconfigure and create solutions with the broad capabilities we have is another advantage",0.6
I'll just give you an example again with the five-year security testbed,0.8
A number of our Aerospace and Defense customers wanted to prototype this threat environment in the lab,-0.9
We were the ones that were able to provide them the solutions,0.0
"So, hopefully, those help",0.8
"
Mehdi Hosseini
Your revenue from Europe was up double-digit on a sequential basis",0.0
"Was that driven by OEM customers, OEM incumbent companies, or is that more of a broad base",0.0
"
Neil Dougherty
We don't look at Europe or many other regions on a sequential basis because there is such seasonality built into our customer base, as well as into even our sales force and the commissions and how that works out",0.0
"So, we look at it on a year-over-year compare and that's why we've taken it modestly to 5% order growth and 2% revenue growth for the quarter",0.8
"

Mark Wallace
Yes",0.0
And this is Mark,0.1
"I would just add again like I said before, we did see some softness in certain end markets last year particularly automotive",0.1
There was some mixed conditions in Aerospace and Defense and we're starting to see some moderating trends in that respect,-0.2
We're starting to see some improvements in semiconductor,0.8
"We're seeing our broad-based customers and the solutions we're providing to them, shows some signs of improvement as well",1.0

Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America",0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
David Ridley-Lane
Good afternoon",1.0
I wanted to get a little bit more color on what – helping to drive the aerospace defense revenue and order growth and was that you – did you see any potentially budget flush at the end of the year or do you feel like this is pretty good underlying payment as well,1.0
"
Satish Dhanasekaran
Yes, hi",0.0
This is Satish,-0.1
I will take it,0.1
"On the Aerospace and Defense front, record orders this quarter, building on the $1 billion record finish we had last year",0.0
"So, very pleased with the results so far",1.0
The budget stability in the U,0.7
S,-0.1
is a big contribution factor,0.3
"There is a lot of program wins that are being awarded by DoD, that’s flowing through to the prime contractors in the supply chain",1.0
"
Our differentiated capability combined with decades of providing solutions to the space position us well",1.0
"In particular, our Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Solutions, Space and Satellite solutions are receiving good growth for us in that region",1.0
"We also see a broader – internationally, a broader wave of defense modernization where people are re-tooling and upgrading their capabilities, and that position us well for the long run",0.8
"
David Ridley-Lane
And then a different topic, the sales force expansion, can you maybe talk about how the recent hires are ramping up in productivity and just sort of your early results on those hirers, potentially biased you towards increasing your sales headcounts even further",-0.9
Thank you,1.0
"
Mark Wallace
Sure",0.1
This is Mark; I'll make a comment on that,0.1
"So, we are on track in making really good progress with doubling the number of frontline sellers across key site and next week, at the Investor Day conference, I will be outlining a tremendous amount of detail on where we stand and what our next steps are",1.0
"What I can tell you is we are hiring across all regions, we're focused on where the growth is",0.9
"
So, we're concentrating our hires to where we see the best opportunities, and we're equipping our teams with the right tools and training",1.0
"So not only are we seeing an increase in capacity in terms of just the number of frontline sellers we've deployed, but their productivity is also improving as well",0.9
"So, again, stay tuned for more",0.0

Congrats on a great quarter,1.0

Adam Thalhimer
I wanted to ask first about Millimeter Wave, your thoughts on Millimeter Wave in general and how it's performing in the field",0.1
"
Neil Dougherty
Yes, it's still very early days for millimeter wave deployments at scale",-0.4
"I would say that, you know a large part of the deployment so far subscale 6-gigahertz and still even there, there's a lot of challenges that our customers face, which is why our tools continue to be embraced and are helping with scaling up the ecosystem",1.0
"
The other factor I would mention here is this sort of heterogeneous spectrum environment both with new frequency bands and the higher frequency bands getting integrated is creating sort of this cycle of demand for our tools in this marketplace",0.1
"So, very early days overall with millimeter-wave, and but there is no doubt that millimeter-wave will be realized just because of all the spectrum that's being put in place and the high innovation that currently the ecosystem is undergoing",0.5
Eventually there will be millimeter-wave based offerings with [time],0.0

Adam Thalhimer
Okay",-0.3

"Your net debt is now, I think, tied for the lowest since the IPO",-1.0
What are your thoughts on cash deployment,0.0
"And on M&amp;A, is there any big out there you could do or do you think it's more about continued tuck-ins",0.0
"
Ron Nersesian
Yes",0.1
I don't think you see any – we don't expect to have any significant changes to our capital allocation priorities,-0.9
"We're looking to strike balance with what we'll do, we continue to invest, to drive organic growth in the investments we're making in R&amp;D close to $700 million per year, the investments Mark just talked about in terms of doubling our sales force",0.7
"
You mentioned M&amp;A, we have an active funnel development process, but we'll remain patient and disciplined when it comes to that, but we are out there actively looking for opportunities to add value – add value through acquisitions",0.0
"And then we're returning capital as well, right",0.3
"We have, I think, $335 million remaining on the authorization that we have outstanding, which is $75 million worth of stock this last quarter",1.0
"And so, I think you'll see us continue to strike that balance and will trade off amongst those categories as appropriate over time",-0.8

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citigroup Investments",0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
Your line is open,0.0
"
Jim Suva
Thank you",1.0
And I have two questions now and at the same time so you can take them in any order that you'd like to,1.0
"If I heard correctly, it sounds like the coronavirus you believe is just a push out",-1.0
"So, the question I have is, does it impact the revenue guidance only in the revenues or did it also impact the orders",0.0
"And the reason why I ask is the orders I believe were up about 12% year-over-year, up 11% on a core basis, which looks like the orders actually reaccelerated, but I understand the coronavirus on sales",0.0
I just don't know about the impact orders or some hesitancy on orders also,0.0
"
Then my second question is, when we think about you expanding your sales force, you mentioned kind of across all the front lines in all regions",0.0
Is it also going into more different types of work like more higher volume or still very focused on the R&amp;D side of things or how should we kind of think about you guys really putting up a lot of more resources behind the sales force expansion,0.1
Thank you,1.0
"
Ron Nersesian
Thanks, Jim",1.0
I'll start off first with the coronavirus,0.0
"First of all, we didn't see any impact on Q1 orders",-0.9
"As you know, our Q1 ends at the end of January and right near the end of January a matter of fact I was in China I think it was the third week of January",0.1
People were at that point starting to head out for Chinese New Year,0.0
"So, people had planned ahead, so that's great",1.0
"Going forward in Q2, we're assuming, it will hit us with about 2% or 3%, but we're very happy with our backlog situation and accordingly we've guided the revenue as we did",1.0
"
Mark Wallace
And Jim, this is Mark",0.2
I will make a few more comments,0.2
"I don't want to steal all the thunder from next week, but there's basically three areas that we're concentrating and deploying more selling capacity",-0.6
"One is, we've talked a lot about acquiring new customers and increasing our reach into the geographies to diversify and broaden our business",0.1
"So, we're continuing on that",0.0
We are also deploying e-commerce as part of that as well from an efficiency standpoint,0.0
"
Our focus on solutions remains one of our top priorities and that includes how we sell and the value we contribute to our customers",0.7
And the third area of concentrated focus is around services and selling our software portfolio,0.0
"A year-and-a-half ago, we launched a services sales channel and we continue to expand that including a focus on the renewal part of our business, which is helping to feed and grow our recurring revenue",0.7
"So, again, more coming next week",0.0
I appreciate the interest,1.0

Brian Yun
",0.2
software opportunity,0.4
"First, are you able to share what software is as a percent of revenues this quarter",0.0
"And then, just broadly, if you can talk about how software is being purchased today, what percent of sales or licenses versus subscription and if you see that changing over the next few years",0.0
"And then, finally, I think the 5G test measurement software use case is very clear, but maybe if you can expand on the automotive software opportunity",0.0
"
Ron Nersesian
Yes",0.1
Let me just make a couple of comments with regards to software,0.0
Orders grew double-digits,0.0
"Revenue grew single digits, but the growth was driven a lot by our network emulation solutions and our network assurance business",0.9
"The great thing is and why we see the order growth higher than the revenue growth, we continue to shift our portfolio from more and more subscription services over time so we could see more recurring revenue",1.0
"And we're working on increasing our ARR, and that's not an instantaneous change, but we're very pleased with the direction that we're taking",1.0
"
Neil Dougherty
And then, I will just add that, the – what we're providing to our customers are complete solutions, and that's the combination of hardware and software and the services",0.2
"So, all of this is coming together around the solutions play, whether it's around our 5G or a network application security solutions, or as you mentioned the automotive solutions, that is a large and growing part of our portfolio",0.9
"
And I think the difference that's occurring now is accelerating is the way customers consume those applications in terms of a more of a subscription based model",0.0
"So, over time, we're supporting them with updates through a renewal process or through services, which support the application that's being deployed whether it's automotive or 5G",1.0

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the IntriCon Corp's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call",0.4

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Leigh Salvo of Investor Relations",0.3
"Please go ahead, ma'am",0.1

Leigh Salvo
Thank you, Laurie",1.0
"Before we begin, I would like to preface our remarks with the customary Safe Harbor statement",0.9
Today's conference call contains certain forward-looking statements,0.0
These statements are based on the current estimates and assumptions of IntriCon's management and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances,-1.0

Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements",-1.0

"And at that point, we'll open the call for your questions",0.0
"
Mark Gorder
Thank you, Leigh, and thank you everyone for joining us today",1.0
"In 2019, our team committed to several priorities that included meeting the volume demands of our key customers and partners, pursuing new business opportunities and partnerships that could best leverage our core competencies to accelerate growth and importantly, diversify our revenue base",0.3
"
We made meaningful progress throughout the year, including many strategic decisions and material adjustments to our operations, that ultimately has enabled IntriCon to enter 2020 inspired with a strong dedication and sharp focus on what we do best, delivering complex micro miniature devices that require specialized design expertise and high production volumes",0.2
"
I'm especially encouraged by an expanding pipeline of near-term growth opportunities we see emerging",0.9
"And accordingly, we are taking the necessary steps today to ensure we are optimally organized to act quickly and prudently",1.0
"
We remain steadfast in our commitment to be a leading joint development manufacturing partner for miniature medical devices, including micro-miniature products, microelectronics, micromechanical assemblies and complete assemblies that enable affordable and accessible healthcare and improve the quality of life for those we serve",0.0
"
Our platform technology currently addresses several high-growth medical markets, including diabetes, drug delivery, surgical navigation, and hearing health",0.0
"With regards to diabetes, Medtronic is our largest single customer, represented 60% of our total revenue in 2019",0.0
"
Undoubtedly, we were affected throughout the year by the timing of their ongoing global commercial product launch of the 670G and the competitive pressures domestically that they have highlighted in recent commentary",-0.1
"Coming off two years of robust Medtronic's diabetes growth of 50% and 58% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, growth slowed notably in 2019 to 5% due to the aforementioned reasons",0.5
"

We are encouraged by the recent launch of the 670G in select European countries, sales of which have partially offset declines in the domestic market and we remain well positioned to meet significantly greater Medtronic diabetes volume well into the future",0.9
"
However, due to the ongoing headwinds that impacted their diabetes business in 2019, as outlined in our recent commentary, we are applying a more tempered outlook for this business in 2020",-0.8
"That said, as a top supplier and integral part of Medtronic's mission to deliver superior products in diabetes management, we continue to see tremendous value and long-term growth potential with this important customer in our Medical business",0.9
"
As I noted, a top priority in 2019 was the pursuit of business development opportunities that leverage our core competencies and diversify our revenue base",0.3
"We believe it's critical that we focus our efforts on driving toward a more predictable revenue model, with sustained growth potential and corresponding operating leverage",-0.9
"
Said simply, our strategy must evolve in order to most efficiently create long-term value for our shareholders",0.8
"In order to accomplish this, last year we began to actively seek new opportunities and partnerships that could best diversify our medical customer base and expand our addressable markets",0.9
"
Our needle assembly competency has provided significant opportunities within the drug delivery market",0.0
"Through our long-standing relationships with key customers, such as Smiths Medical our drug delivery business increased in the mid-teens in 2019 and now represents 6% of our total 2019 business",0.0
"
We are currently pursuing other needle assembly opportunities, which could be additive in 2020",0.0
"As we've highlighted on previous calls, surgical navigation is an area where we see meaningful near-term upside and more specifically, the areas of interventional pulmonology and electrophysiology",0.0
"
I'm delighted to announce that we have identified several opportunities that could quickly leverage our microminiature electronics, precision molding and medical coil technologies into markets that have high-growth rates and steep technology curves",0.9
"
We have taken the important next step to add additional engineering capacity to support our growth in medical coil and catheter assemblies to meet the demands of current customers and to support the development of future customers",0.8
"We expect this year to continue to build out this infrastructure with sales and marketing support, reallocating resources and optimizing efficiencies in our existing business",0.9
"While we are making meaningful progress, it is premature to talk more specifically about these opportunities",-0.5
We look forward to providing updates when appropriate,0.8
"
Our third priority in 2019 was to seek partnerships with best-in-class entrants in the emerging over-the-counter hearing aid market",0.5
"Throughout the year we made great progress identifying and aligning IntriCon with potential high-profile partners that value our ability to deliver superior hearing aids, self-fitting software and customer care to the U",1.0
S,-0.1
market,0.1
"
I'm encouraged by the progress we've continued to make in our discussions with several commercial entities that are actively pursuing end customer healthcare initiatives and specifically, solutions for the hearing health market, including retailers, branding partners and pharmacies",0.7
"
While this landscape and the associated time line is still taking shape, we are confidently moving forward in identifying a path that we believe best positions us to benefit from the pending change in hearing healthcare regulation, which opens the hearing aid market to over-the-counter sales",0.9
"
Despite no recent updates on the draft guidance of the pending OTC hearing aid regulation, given the high cost of hearing aids today we remain excited by the tremendous potential this change could have for hearing-impaired consumers",0.7
"

In order to concentrate on opportunities that ensure we most effectively leverage our resources, we have made the decision to pivot our direct-to-end-consumer initiatives through Hearing Help Express entirely towards supporting product development and as a testing platform in order to best capture the near-term benefits we see through an indirect-to-end-consumer approach",0.2
"
As a result of this repositioning, advertising and marketing spend related to Hearing Help Express will decrease significantly beginning in the second quarter of 2020",-0.9
"Furthermore, while the pivot will result in lower revenue for 2020, it allows us to de-risk our business and increase profitability",-1.0
"
We acknowledge that considerable investment was made towards launching a direct end-to-end consumer approach to the hearing healthcare market",0.0
"And while we are no longer pursuing this channel today, we have gained invaluable insight into consumer preferences, strengths and weaknesses of solutions available today and where the best opportunity lies for gaining immediate consumer traction",1.0
"
This insight enabled us to emerge as stronger candidate to those entities seeking the partner to best pursue this market",1.0
"It also provides us with a very attractive platform for new entrants into this market that are seeking a partner that can bring teleaudiology, customer care service and support to the table",0.9
"
In the direct-to-end-consumer channel more specifically, in the direct-to-end-consumer channel revenue declined during the fourth quarter as we began to reduce investments in advertising and marketing in Hearing Help Express",-0.1
"As I noted earlier, we are repositioning this business to support product development",1.0
"
While lower – while revenue was lower accordingly, so were losses associated with this business",-1.0
"As anticipated, we experienced a meaningful revenue decline in the second half of the year as a result of hi HealthInnovations decision to shift towards a more traditional brick-and-mortar approach to hearing healthcare that no longer align with our partnership strategy and approach to reaching the end consumer",0.5
"
In the fourth quarter we made final shipments to hi HealthInnovations",0.0
"And subsequently, we have reallocated our resources and efforts to enhance our consumer-centric ecosystem of care and target other opportunities with the potential for better long-term results",0.9
"
Along those lines in anticipation of the OTC Hearing Aid Regulation, we are working with several potential branding partners that could utilize our hearing aid technology, self-fitting software technology and customer care expertise",0.6
We believe these relationships will take on different forms as several delivery models will be tested once the final regulation is in place,0.0
"
Additionally, we have also initiated our clinical trial process for our self-fitting software, which we intend to have complete in conjunction with the final OTC regulations",0.1
"In summary, we believe our long-term success in the hearing healthcare market will largely be driven by our indirect-to-end-consumer channel",0.3
"
As such, we are reprioritizing our investments to more clearly focus on securing high-profile partners that value our ability to deliver an ecosystem of care platform, which includes superior hearing aids, self-fitting software and customer care to the U",0.9
S,-0.1
market,0.1
"
As we look forward to 2020, we see a continuation of work done in 2019 towards diversifying and building a sustainable pipeline of growth opportunities",1.0
"
The next phase includes four key priorities for the year; first, continue to meet the volume demands of Medtronic's diabetes business; second, accelerate the diversification of our non-diabetes revenue by leveraging our already established core technology platforms; third, continue to pursue and secure partnerships that could utilize our hearing aid technology, self-fitting software technology and customer care expertise; and finally, implement an organizational structure that best aligns with our focus on driving a sustainable pipeline of growth opportunities",0.0
"

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott to discuss our financials and guidance in more detail",1.0
"
Scott Longval
Thank you, Mark",1.0
Turning to our financial results,0.3
"For the 2019 fourth quarter, we reported net revenue of $27",0.0
"7 million, a decrease of 8",0.0
8% over the prior year period,-0.1
"The decrease was primarily due to the significant decline in revenue to High Health Innovations in our legacy hearing health OEM business, partially offset by growth in our non-diabetes Medical business",0.4
"
By core business segment, revenues in our Medical business for the quarter were $21",0.0
"3 million, a 5",0.0
7% increase year-over-year and represented 76,0.0
9% of total revenue,0.0
"This growth was largely due to strong medical coil sales, which grew 82% from the prior year",-0.7
"In our Hearing Health business segment, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $4",0.0
"9 million, down 41",0.0
3% over the prior year quarter,-0.1
Once again this decrease was largely due to minimal revenue from High Health Innovations as they shifted towards a more traditional brick-and-mortar approach to hearing health that no longer align with our partnership strategy to reaching the end consumer as Mark noted in his earlier comments,-0.1
"
We believe this transition is largely complete and do not anticipate any additional revenue from this customer in 2020",-0.7
"
Within Hearing Health segment, indirect-to-end-consumer revenue was $1",0.0
"5 million, direct-to-end-consumer revenue through our Hearing Health Express business was $1",0.0
2 million and legacy OEM revenue was $2,0.2
1 million,0.0
"
Fourth quarter gross margins were 26",0.0
"9%, down from 29",-0.1
9% in the prior year fourth quarter,-0.1
Gross margins were constrained primarily due to excess capacity related to recent manufacturing expansion to meet the anticipated higher volume requirements of our existing and future customers,-0.9
"
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $6",-0.3
7 million compared to $7,0.0
7 million in the prior year period,0.0
The decrease stems from a substantial reduction in advertising and administrative expense in Hearing Help Express,-0.1
"We posted a profit attributable to shareholders of $768,000 or $0",0.0
"08 per diluted share versus net income attributable to shareholders of $868,000 or $0",0.0
09 per diluted share for the 2018 fourth quarter,0.0
"
For the full year ended, December 31, 2019 IntriCon reported revenue of $113",-0.2
5 million relatively flat with 2018,0.0
Gross margins were 27,0.0
3% down from 31,-0.1
9% in 2018,0.0
Again the decrease in margin was primarily due to excess capacity related to the recent manufacturing expansion,-1.0
"
Operating expenses were $33 million compared to $27",0.0
9 million in the prior year period,0.0
The increase stemmed from a one-time non-cash impairment charge of $3,0.0
8 million and an increase in administrative expenses,0.0
Net loss attributable to shareholders was $3,-0.8
8 million or $0,0.0
43 per diluted share versus $5,0.0
5 million or $0,0.0
64 per diluted share in 2018,0.0
"
Turning to our guidance",0.7
We expect full year 2020 revenue to a range of $110 million to $114 million,0.0
"While we do not anticipate providing regular quarter guidance, we did want to offer some direction on our expectations for the first quarter revenue in the range of $23",-0.3
5 million to $24,0.0
5 million,0.0
"
Full year 2020 gross margin is expected to range between 26% and 27%",0.0
"In general, we anticipate linear revenue growth and gross margin improvement throughout 2020",0.4
"However, this could be impacted by commercial product launch timing from our largest customer",0.0
"
More specifically, we anticipate a more tempered diabetes business in 2020 due to the ongoing domestic pressures that Mark commented on earlier",-0.1
"In our Hearing Health business, we do not anticipate any financial upside in 2020 as a result of the pending OTC Hearing Aid Regulation",-0.1
"
Longer term I believe we are well-positioned for continued growth from our core businesses",1.0
"In addition to our revenue growth opportunities, we anticipate that over time we will be able to leverage our current manufacturing infrastructure and expand gross margins into the mid-30% range",0.6
"

Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator so Mark and I can take questions",1.0

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Jon Block from Stifel",0.0
Please ask your question,0.0
"
Jon Block
Thanks",1.0
Good afternoon guys,1.0
I'll try to keep it to maybe three and then follow-up offline,0.0
But the first one Mark and/or Scott is on the DTC hearing business,0.0
Can you give a little bit more color to the pivot and strategy that you laid out,0.0
I'm just also trying to tie it back from a revenue perspective,0.0
"
In other words, are you taking orders from only existing customers but not new customers",-0.7
What does that mean if we think about revenues specific to DTC hearing in 2020 which was sort of run rating south of a $5 million business exiting 2019,-0.2
"
Mark Gorder
Jon the way I would characterize that is we're trying not -- we're trying to control the direct-to-consumer marketing spend and reduce that to a test platform",-0.1
"There's still ongoing revenue from the existing database which could be efficiently managed, but we're trying to make sure that we are not spending to try to become a direct-to-consumer channel because we think our best bet is to partner with these emerging retail branding partners that we're working with",1.0
Does that answer your question,0.0
"
Scott Longval
Jon maybe I'll interject as it relates to 2020 in terms of revenue expectations",0.1
"Clearly, we believe based on the repositioning of this business that the topline revenue will be notably lower than where we finished 2019",-0.1
"
Jon Block
Okay",-0.2
"So, that's a good segue to my second question Scott",1.0
"So, I know you probably don't want to get too specific on the top line",0.0
"But if I look at your $110 million to $114 million for the year call it $112 million at the midpoint, let me throw out a couple of numbers and maybe if you can respond",0.0
"
If Medical were $85 million to $87 million; Hearing, $18 million to $20 million; and Professional Audio, $6 million; I mean is that the right ZIP code to be in where that Hearing business has actually sort of south possibly south of a $20 million business due to some of the recent data points that we got this particular quarter",0.8
"
Scott Longval
Exactly",0.7
All those ranges seem right in line with kind of our expectations,1.0
And again we tried to lay out what was impacting our thought process in terms of 2020 and I think we captured that in terms of the numbers you just alluded to,0.0
"
Jon Block
Okay",-0.2
"So, last one for me is going to be a little bit maybe more higher level or strategic",0.0
"Mark I'm guessing with the pivot in strategy in DTC hearing, you don't do that I would think unless maybe you've got some increased conviction on how this market evolves and the demand of potential partners knocking on your door wanting to do something with you guys from a strategic standpoint",0.0
So maybe if you can talk to that,0.0
"What was -- what have you seen occur over the past six to nine months which says, hey you know what let's shutter this DTC thing and use this platform to really go after the IDTEC",0.1
Maybe if you can just give us a feel on the demand out there for your services as a key supplier and partner,0.0
Thanks guys,1.0
"
Mark Gorder
Good question Jon",1.0
"I think the -- what we've seen is we're talking to a number of these different potential channel partners all of them -- I would say all of them, but most of them do not have expertise in Hearing Health",-0.7
"And they are looking for a partner that can deliver hearing care devices, in other words this ecosystem of care",1.0
"So, they value some of the things that we learned by developing our expertise at HHE in addition to the things that IntriCon brings to the table",0.6
"And we think that although, it's not for certain exactly which partners will emerge and how that – those channels will unfold we do believe that they will value our assets that we have developed looking forward to delivering this ecosystem of care",1.0
And we think we've learned that much to feel that we're pretty convicted in that direction,-0.8
"

Jon Block
All right",1.0

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew D'Silva from B",0.0
Riley FBR,0.1
Please ask your question,0.0
"
Andrew D'Silva
Good afternoon",1.0
Thanks for taking my question,1.0
Just to start-off could you please just let me know what depreciation amortization cash flow from operations and CapEx was for the quarter,0.0
And then while you're pulling that info taking a look at that if there are particularly taking into account the non-adjunctive aspect of the 670G,0.0
And then maybe the transmitter reorders with existing customers the re-ups typically four years for the pump but two years for the transmitters,0.0
Just curious on what's going on or going into the CGM guidance,0.1
"
Scott Longval
Thanks, Andy",1.0
This is Scott,0.2
Some of the housekeeping items first,0.0
"Your depreciation amortization number is $830,000 for the quarter",0.0
"Stock-based comp was $369,000 for the quarter",0.0
"CapEx was $806,000 and so the negative cash flow from operations of $545,000",-1.0
"
In terms of your question in regards to our calculus in guidance for Medtronic in 2020, obviously, they've had some recent comments in terms of what's going on in the marketplace the competitive pressures they're facing domestically and now just starting to kind of get the international rollout going",-0.1
"Clearly, as we look at 2019 that business did not meet our expectations",-0.9
"And so as we started thinking about 2020, we wanted to come in from a position of providing the guidance that we saw in front of us that we feel very confident in",1.0
"And so some of the additive pieces that may impact this business in 2020, we did not account for as we thought about our full year guidance and more specifically speaking to the non-adjunctive CGM and then getting approval on that because we don't know exactly how that will be impacting our business and the timing that that approval will come",-0.1
"
Andrew D'Silva
Got it",0.3
Okay,-0.8
And looking at their print while – as far as Medtronic's diabetes goes it's essentially flat year-over-year,0.0
But when you kind of break it down a little further they did show teens growth on the CGM side of the business,0.7
"Like, how are you looking at the CGM growth that they're putting out even on a fairly flat top line, when you're looking at your guidance",0.9
Are you basing it more on just the overall top line the Medtronic's showing,0.0
Or are you actually delving into some of the CGM aspects as well,0.0
"
Scott Longval
Well, there's – that's a great question, Andy",1.0
And there's some puts and takes there clearly because one of the faster-growing parts of their diabetes business is related to the CGM in the disposable part of that business,0.7
"So obviously, we would anticipate that to grow a little bit greater than their top line total",0.3
"Again though, as we look into – look forward into 2020 and without them providing definitive guidance on what they view their next year to be we wanted to again take an approach where we felt very comfortable with the number that was out there",0.9
"And then obviously, as Medtronic has talked about the attention to getting that business back on track getting their sensor platform back on track, we believe that throughout the year there is potential upside, but again things that we did not want to model into our range for the initial guidance that we're giving",-0.1
"
Andrew D'Silva
Okay",0.2
And are you -- is there any sort of impact that just generally not the CDM related or anything,0.0
"But just on the coronavirus, is there any sort of impact that you've accounted for in there",0.0
"
Scott Longval
Well, and clearly that was something that they highlighted on their call and the impact of that",0.6
"And for me to start trying to guess what the coronavirus impact could have on Medtronic's business, I think would be a little bit irresponsible",-1.0
"So, again…3

Andrew D’Silva
I mean, overall, just on your overall business did you have -- did you account for any sort of coronavirus impact total IntriCon sales",-0.1
"
Scott Longval
Well, again, because most of our revenue is domestic in terms of our business we put very little impact of what the coronavirus could be from our top line",0.3
"Now that being said, as you know we have Asian operations specifically in Singapore and Indonesia and we have taken extensive measures to make sure that we are doing everything we can within our control to ensure there's no disruption in our manufacturing ability in those facilities",0.2
"
Andrew D’Silva
Okay",0.1
Okay,-0.8
Fair enough,0.2
And just a couple of quick ones that relates to the hearing health side of the business,0.0
"Just I don't know if the FDA's guidance, obviously, you've noted that that's going to be a moving target for you and not to have any robust expectations as it relates to change in cadence in your Hearing Health business in the interim",0.7
But they've already codified that the self-fitting asset last year,0.7
And as you look at the Indirect to end-consumer part of the business can you help me understand like what are some of the gives and takes,1.0
Or what's really holding it up,0.0
Is it just interpreting what the language means as far as perceived,0.0
When we're looking at a perceived milder and moderate hearing loss are there other key items that we should be really thinking about when the draft guide eventual final rules come out,-0.5
"
Mark Gorder
Well, I think Andy, the one thing we do know there's a fixed time line on this",0.7
The legislation requires that the FDA act by August of 2020,0.0
"So even though the delay and guidance has been longer than we anticipated, they're still up against a fixed deadline",-1.0
"And we -- I hate to speculate on what I've heard about when it's going to come up, because I said last time I thought it would come out based on some correspondence that we got from the FDA themselves that it was going to be in late November early December and that didn't happen",-1.0
And -- but they're up against the fixed time line so they're going to have to get something done here relatively soon in order for them to make their own deadlines,-0.6
"
Andrew D’Silva
Right",0.6
"But as far as what's kind of stopping further partnering opportunities as you're waiting for the guidance to come out, are we -- are you really looking at just particular aspects that are in limbo right now",-0.8
And if you could elaborate what they might be,0.0
And one of the questions that was asked perceived versus -- perceived falls into the mild or moderate category or whatever might be holding things up,-0.3
I'm just curious what…,0.1
"
Mark Gorder
I don't think Andy that they're going to move off of that requirement for mild to moderate",0.1
Then they've already given some indication of their thinking when they approve the Bose de novo back in October of last year,0.0
And that pretty specifically lays out some criteria for the output power and so forth of a device that would go into that category,0.0
"
So I don't think they will back off on that",0.0
I think it's more procedural things that are holding it up,0.0
But at IntriCon we are moving ahead as though it's going to be enacted in the August-September time frame,0.0
And we're making our investments in our clinical trial in our ecosystem of care to be prepared,1.0
"
So the one -- the only thing we can control is make sure that our ecosystem of care platform is ready to go in 2020 and be aligned in discussions with as many branding partners as we can to assure that we're in one of the channels that's going to start to make some -- to get some traction",0.9
"
Andrew D’Silva
Okay",0.1
Last question from a sales and marketing standpoint,0.0
"When we look back before you acquiring Hearing Help Express, your sales and marketing was about one-third of where it was maybe a little bit more than one-third of where it was now",-0.1
What should we expect,0.9
It looks that you're kind of moving away from the DTP,0.0
Should you kind of go back to where you were a few years back,0.0
"

Scott Longval
Andy this is Scott",0.4
Thanks for the question,1.0
There's a couple of pieces,0.0
"Clearly, as we think about pivoting that business dropping our advertising and selling expense be a notable decline from where we've been",-0.5
We are though as Mark mentioned in his comments looking to add resources in the sales and marketing side to support some of the growth opportunities we're seeing on the medical side of our business,1.0
"But that being said, we will see a decline on the sales and marketing side back down to sub-$10 million on the sales and marketing expense for 2020",0.0
"
Andrew D'Silva
All right",1.0
Great,1.0
Thank you very much for taking the questions and good luck for 2020,1.0
"
Scott Longval
Thank you, Andy",1.0
Appreciate you time,1.0
"
Operator
And we have a follow-up question from Jon Block from Stifel",0.0
Please ask your question,0.0
"
Jon Block
Hey guys thanks",1.0
I'm going to keep it to one quick follow-up,0.0
But here's a question that I think I'm going to get quite frequently,0.0
"So Scott, I think I certainly expected the guidance to be back-end weighted",-0.1
"But if we take $24 million for 1Q revenue and trying to get to the midpoint of the annual, it implies you've got sort of $29 million so let's just take $29 million for the balance of the year I believe",0.0
"Yet you're saying the guidance is conservative because it doesn't reflect a pickup from Medtronic on the 780 or it doesn't reflect anything coming in, in the back part of the year from hearing",-0.4
So then why the step up,0.0
Or what drives a step up,0.0
"So in light of -- with all due respect missing your guidance a couple of times in 2019, you got to get the Street comfortable that this truly is a conservative guide",1.0
So can you be as specific as possible as what is driving the $24 million 1Q up to an average of $29 million if it doesn't reflect those incrementals on each side of that business,0.0
Thanks very much,1.0
"
Scott Longval
Sure",0.1
"Thanks, Jon for the question",1.0
I think there's a couple of factors that are impacting that linear approach,0.0
And both really on the Medical side of the ledger with the guidance that we're giving in the first quarter there are certain inventory levels that are being managed by our largest customer Medtronic,-0.1
"And understanding what the order flow looks like for the first half of the year, we see a significant step-up from where we are in the first quarter to the second quarter",0.1
"
And that's pretty much baked into our discussions and understanding of the trajectory of the business and overall ties to some of the preliminary comments that Medtronic has made publicly",0.0
The other piece of that Jon are some of these other medical initiatives that we've been working on for quite some time,-0.1
We've seen again kind of that continuous growth in our non-Diabetes Medical business,0.9
And we continue to see and anticipate that business to grow in a linear fashion throughout 2020,0.0

Thanks, Anna",1.0
"Welcome, everybody",0.9
We appreciate your time today,1.0
I’ll begin with a commercial update for Rubraca,0.0
I’m pleased to report that our global net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $39,1.0
"3 million, a 5% sequentially from Q3 2019 and up 30% over Q4 2018",0.0
The sequential quarter growth was driven primarily by increased revenue in Germany and launches in England and Italy during the fourth quarter,0.1
"
For the full-year 2019, global net revenue was $143 million, up 50% from 2018",0.0
The year-over-year growth for the quarter and the year was driven largely by growth in U,0.5
S,-0.1
"sales, including overall growth in total volume and better management of the patient assistance program, offset to some extent by higher gross to net adjustments",0.8
"
We’ve seen stepwise growth over the last several quarters, including the 12% increase in U",0.3
S,-0.1
"sales from Q2 2019 to Q3 2019, and are pleased that we have maintained this higher level of sales in Q4 2019",0.9
"
Our key near-term objectives remain the same",0.0
Grow U,0.2
S,-0.1
"ovarian cancer revenues by increasing market share in and overall adoption of the maintenance treatment indication in the recurrent ovarian cancer setting, increase European revenues through Rubraca ovarian cancer launches in England, Italy, France and Spain, along with driving continued revenue growth in Germany",-1.0
"

I should note that the adoption of maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer in Europe is similar to that of the U",-1.0
S,-0.1
", and we and our competitors are making considerable efforts overcome observation or watching and wait as a standard approach to treating recurrent ovarian cancer",-1.0
"
And hopefully, on for before our PDUFA date of May 15, begin to grow revenue through the addition of the potential new indication in the U",0.0
S,-0.1
"for the treatment of BRCA1/2-mutant recurrent, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, or MCRPC",-1.0
And that brings us to our most near-term development and regulatory program in this setting,0.0
"
In November 2019, we submitted our planned supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, for Rubraca as a monotherapy treatment of adult patients with BRCA1/2-mutant recurrent, metastatic CRPC",-0.2
The filing was based on data from the TRITON2 clinical program and advanced prostate cancer,-1.0
"
In January 2020, we announced that the FDA accepted our sNDA for Rubraca and granted priority review status to the application with a PDUFA date of May 15, 2020",0.0
We are actively preparing for Rubraca launch in prostate cancer in the U,-1.0
S,-0.1
", which we will commence upon receipt of FDA approval",0.0
We think that Rubraca represents an important hormone-free and chemotherapy-free option for our targeted population of men in the U,0.6
S,-0.1
", who have metastatic CRPC, approximately 12% of whom have a mutation of BRCA",0.0
"
We’ve been encouraged by our interactions with both the medical community and, to a lesser extent, the urology community about the potential of Rubraca to address the unmet medical need in recurrent CRPC",0.3
"We are actively engaged in launch preparations, including sales force training and we will be ready to launch on approval, which we expect to occur on or before May 15",0.0
"
Now, I’ll briefly discuss the latest updates to our clinical pipeline through Rubraca",0.1
"During the fourth quarter, we initiated the LODESTAR study, our Phase 2 and tumor study to evaluate Rubraca in homologous recombination repair genes across tumor types",-1.0
"The study will evaluate Rubraca in patients with recurrent solid tumors associated with the deleterious homologous recombination repair, or HRR gene mutations",-0.5
"
Based on our interactions with FDA, this study may be registration-enabling for a targeted gene and tumor-agnostic label, if data from the trial support an accelerated approval",-0.6
"
Next, I’d like to briefly highlight our combination studies with BMS for both Rubraca and Lucitanib, and then I’ll discuss our newest compound FAP-2286",0.9
We remain enthusiastic about our ongoing clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb,0.7
I’ll take a moment to review certain of our combination studies for both Rubraca and Lucitanib with nivolumab,0.3
"
I’ll begin with Rubraca combinations",0.0
"FRACTION-GC is a BMS-sponsored multi-arm Phase 2 study, evaluating the combinations of each of Opdivo and Yervoy with Rubraca, as well as Opdivo, Yervoy and Rubraca in combination for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer",-0.4
This is the first-sponsored study to explore this triplet combination and it is now enrolling patients into the safety lead-in portion of the study,0.0
"
The Clovis-sponsored Phase 3 ATHENA trial in first-line maintenance for advanced ovarian cancer continues to enroll well, and we anticipate completing enrollment in this 1,000-patient study in the second quarter of 2020",-0.7
"With ATHENA, we believe we are uniquely positioned to evaluate Rubraca in terms of two outcomes",0.0
"
As monotherapy versus placebo in the first-line maintenance setting in the HRD population, inclusive of BRCA, and in the all-comers or intent-to-treat population, as well as any potential advantage of the combination of Rubraca and Opdivo in the same patient population",0.0
"ATHENA is the first front-line switch maintenance study designed to show both, PARP monotherapy and PARP PD-1 combination therapy in one study design",0.0
"

I’ll take a moment to review the analysis plan for ATHENA",0.2
"First, expected in the second-half of 2021, we will see the results of Rubraca monotherapy versus placebo in all study populations and then probably a year or more later, we will see the results of Rubraca plus Opdivo versus Rubraca in all study populations",-0.2
"In each of these analyses, we will first evaluate outcomes in the HRD population, including BRCA and then step down to the entire intent-to-treat population",-0.1
"
To wrap up Rubraca and move to lucitanib, I’ll note that SEASTAR, our Clovis- sponsored Phase 1b/2 study that includes multiple single-arm Rubraca combination studies, including the combination of Rubraca with lucitanib in ovarian cancer, is currently enrolling the dose-finding Phase Ib portion of the study",-0.9
"
Lucitanib, of course, is our investigational inhibitor tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 through 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta, and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 3",0.2
"
As we have discussed on prior calls, there are very encouraging data in studies of the drug similar to lucitanib, which inhibits the same three pathways when combined with the PD-1 inhibitor",0.6
This provides us a compelling clinical rationale for the development of lucitanib in combination with the PD-1,0.4
"We believe the combination of lucitanib with the PD-1 targeting monoclonal antibody, represents a large potential opportunity in multiple solid tumor types",-0.9
"
Angiogenesis has been shown to be immunosuppressive within the tumor microenvironment, dampening antitumor immune responses",-0.9
"Preclinical data demonstrate that the antitumor activity of the PD-1 inhibitor is enhanced through the inhibition of angiogenesis by lucitanib, which targets three relevant proangiogenic pathways, as well as simultaneously targeting tumor cell proliferation and anti-VEGFR therapy resistance, driven by PDGF and FGF receptors",-0.2
"
In February 2019, we announced the expansion of our clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to include planned combinations of Opdivo with lucitanib",0.0
Our Clovis-sponsored LIO-1 is a Phase 1b/2 study of evaluating lucitanib in combination with Opdivo,0.0
LIO-1 is now enrolling patients with gynecological and other solid tumors,-0.7
"We hope to have preliminary data from this study, as well as the Rubraca/lucitanib combination study at medical meetings in 2020",1.0
"
In addition, the BMS-sponsored CHECKMATE 79X study is a Phase 1/2 study evaluating multiple combinations with Opdivo, including an arm in combination with lucitanib in patients with second-line non-small cell lung cancer",-0.9
This study is expected to initiate in early 2020,0.1
"
Now, let me describe the newest addition to the Clovis pipeline, our peptide-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy program and our lead compound FAP-2286",0.1
"In September 2019, we announced a global licensing collaboration agreement with 3B Pharmaceuticals, with initial focus on a peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy and imaging agent targeting fibroblast activated – activation protein alpha, commonly referred to as FAP",0.0
"
FAP is highly expressed in cancer associated fibroblasts, which are found in the majority of cancer types, potentially making it a suitable target across a wide array of solid tumors",-1.0
"It is highly expressed in many epithelial cancers, including more than 90% of breast, lung, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas",-0.4
"
Clovis will conduct global clinical trials and has obtained U",0.0
S,-0.1
"and global rights, excluding Europe, where three 3B retains rights",0.0
We are planning to submit the IND for FAP-2286 in the second-half of this year,-0.1
"
In addition, we and 3B are collaborating on a discovery program directed to three additional targets for radionuclide therapy, to which we have global rights",0.0
"We were gone to this program for for many reasons, including, of course, the opportunity to be a leader in the emerging field of targeted radiotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors",-0.9
"

In this case, we also have the opportunity to be the first to clinically develop an FAP-targeted radionuclide and we are also enthusiastic about the targets that are the subject of our discovery collaboration",0.8
"
In addition, while our initial development focus is on monotherapy, there is an evident biological rationale to combine targeted radionuclide therapy with cancer therapies, including anti-PD-1 agents, as well as with Rubraca, and we intend to explore these combinations first preclinically and potentially clinically as well",-1.0
"
As some of you may be familiar with the history of PSMA-targeted radionuclide, in particular, lutetium PSMA-617, which was used extensively under named patient use in Germany and certain other countries prior to the initiation of any formal clinical development programs",-0.2
"
We do not anticipate such extensive name patient use like that, which occurred for lutetium PSMA-617, we have had expressions of interest for named patient use from German physicians",0.7
"
To this end in December 2019, Professor Dr",0.1
Richard Baum presented his initial independent clinical experience with FAP-2286 in the first name patient use of the compound in the imaging and treatment settings at the International Centers for Precision Oncology Foundation Symposium in Germany,0.0
"
Professor Dr",0.2
"Baum’s early results in patients with advanced solid tumors, including breast, pancreatic, colorectal and ovarian cancers, showed the following: images of 10 patients imaged with PET/CT with Gallium 68, FAP-2286 were completely consistent the standard of care FDG-PET CT scans in the same patients",-0.6
"
In patients treated with lutetium FAP-2286, there were encouraging tumor accumulation and retention and a reported lack of significant adverse effects was demonstrated within the first two months after the first dose",-1.0
"As a reminder, named patient programs are like clinical trials and the treating physician independently makes all decisions, including dose and assessment of efficacy and safety",0.0
"
We found this reported experience encouraging and our focus remains on initiating a broad clinical development program for our FAP-targeted compound",0.6
"We currently plan submit an IND application for FAP-2286 in the second-half of 2020, followed by a Phase 1 study to determine the dose and tolerability of the FAP-targeting therapeutic agent with expansion cohorts planned in multiple tumor types as part of the global development program",-0.8
"
Thus far, in radiotherapeutic development, physicians have used an imaging agent, mostly Gallium 68, to identify patients with the appropriate level of tumor target, which in our case would be FAP",-1.0
"We are exploring opportunities to generate imaging data for FAP-2286, potentially even before our IND is submitted",0.2
"
Not only would this information will be useful to gain additional experience with FAP-2286 and better understand the characteristics of FAP expression in multiple tumor types, but further it would allow us to collaborate with academic institutions eager to explore the potential of FAP as an imaging and treatment target",0.9
"
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Dan to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 financial results",0.0
"

Thanks, Dan",1.0
Happy Birthday,0.9
We’re pleased with our progress in the fourth quarter and in 2019 in total,1.0
We demonstrated strong sales growth in 2019 with Rubraca in the second-line ovarian cancer maintenance setting,-1.0
In the U,0.0
S,-0.1
", we remain focused on growing our share of the ovarian cancer PARP inhibitor market, as well as expanding second-line maintenance PARP adoption overall",-0.9
"
In Europe, Rubraca is now reimbursed in Germany, England, Italy, France and Spain",0.0
"And during the course of 2019, we launched in Germany, England and Italy",0.0
Rubraca launched earlier this month in France and will launch shortly in Spain – in France and we’ll shortly in Spain,-0.1
"
In addition to our sales progress, we also showed a significant reduction in our net cash utilized in operations, which was 60 – or excuse me, $86",-0.6
"8 million, or 46% lower in the second-half of 2019 than in the first-half of 2019, reflecting reductions in product supply costs, milestone payments, disciplined with headcount additions, clinical trial management and the benefits of the TPG ATHENA financing",0.0
"
We submitted the supplemental NDA for Rubraca in BRCA1/2 mutant recurrent metastatic CRPC in mid-November",-0.4
"And we’re pleased that the FDA granted priority review designation for the application and a PDUFA date of May 15, 2020",1.0
This provides the potential for a U,0.1

We remain enthusiastic about the potential for lucitanib with two Clovis-sponsored combination studies now open for enrollment: one with Rubraca in advanced ovarian cancer as part of SEASTAR, as well as one in combination with Opdivo in advanced gynecological cancers and other solid tumors",-1.0
We hope to have initial data from these trials at medical meetings in 2020,1.0
"
And finally, we look forward to submitting the IND for FAP-2286 in the second-half of 2020 and we’re enthusiastic about the opportunity to develop this compound specifically and potentially up to three additional radionuclide therapies in this emerging field",0.7
"We believe with this program, we have the opportunity to become a leader in the development of this important new treatment modality for multiple solid tumor types",-0.9

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kevin [sic] [Kennen] MacKay from RBC Capital",0.0
"
Kennen MacKay
Hi, thanks for taking the question",0.9
Maybe if you could talk a little bit more about some of the Rubraca dynamics in the U,0.0
S,-0.1
market,0.1
It seems like maybe there was a slight volume decline after backing out the gross to net and free drug impact,0.9
"But would love if you could maybe help contextualize that market and again, the dynamics going on there a little bit more",1.0
"
And then a follow-up on lucitanib",0.0
We saw some very impressive VEGF plus checkpoint data in prostate cancer from the COSMIC trial at ASCO GU,-1.0
"I was wondering if – how you were thinking about targeting prostate cancer with lucitanib, if there are any plans there with the thinking that maybe it would just be a far and less competitive field than the more validated RCC space",-1.0
Thanks so much,1.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
Yep",0.9
"So first dynamic in the market, we actually did see a volume increase in Q4, it was modest, but we did see a volume increase",0.3
"We were affected by the higher gross to net, which reflects some contracting we, as other companies, have done in the space",-1.0
"
The thing I’ll also point to is that while we don’t have a good perfect data set from olaparib, it does appear that sales, for instance, for ZEJULA were also flat to down in Q4, compared to Q3",-1.0
It could just be a dynamic of the quarter,0.0
"
I also think it’s important to note, as I said, in my prepared remarks, we saw a 13% increase in Q3, compared to Q2 and we maintained that increase in Q4",0.0
"And I think that it’s important, as you look back at our reported sales, that our growth hasn’t really occurred on a linear quarterly basis",0.7
"What we’ve seen is, $32 million and $32 million and then jumped to $36 million and now we’re $36 million, and hopefully we’ll see another jump beginning in some quarter in 2020",0.0
"
So I think that we have held our own in this market",0.0
We still need with our competitors to do everything we can to grow adoption of second-line maintenance,0.1
"So that we can really not only take more share, but benefit from kind of a rising tide lifting all boats, a better adoption",1.0
And so that will remain a focus of ours in 2020,0.0
"
As to the data for VEGF inhibitor in – plus PD-L1 that were presented at ASCO GU, obviously, we paid attention that, too",-0.1
"We think it’s worth further exploration for us potentially with the PD-1, potentially if that was of interest to Bristol, but we – it’s early days to figure out what the next step for us would be",-0.3
"But we, like you, were impressed with the data and see an evident opportunity for the combination of the VEGFs for a pan-angiogenesis compound like lucitanib with a PD-1",1.0
"
One thing you said, Kennen, I just want to address, as you said, rather than go into the very crowded RCC space, that has not been our priority",-0.7
"Our priority has been these kind of theological cancers and some other solid tumor indications, where we have precedent data for Keytruda with pembro, but it is not a subject of our study activities now to pursue RCC",-1.0

Kennen MacKay
Got it",0.2

Your next question comes from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim",0.0
"
Michael Schmidt
Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions",1.0
I had a couple around prostate cancer,-1.0
"First of all, congrats on the PDUFA date, the acceptance and then the PDUFA date, obviously",0.9
"Just wondering how you think about the mark the competitive dynamics in BRCA positive prostate cancer longer-term with other companies, obviously, having started additional trials in earlier lines of therapy in mCRPC",-1.0
And just wondering how you think about maybe the initial market dynamics and longer-term the potential for Rubraca and prostate cancer,-1.0
"

Patrick Mahaffy
Yep",0.9
"So we think, for now and for a reasonable future, the PARP inhibitor approvals will be limited to us and to olaparib",0.2
"Each of the other competitors running a single-arm study are reasonably behind based on the enrollment rates that they showed mostly recently at ASCO GU, which was only a couple of weeks ago",-0.3
So that’s pretty up to date data,0.1
"
So we – like anybody, we would love to be alone, but we’re confident that we have a good chance of being first or tied for first based on AZ’s announcement of their timing and obviously ahead of any other competitors",0.9
"So two is better than three, which is what we base in ovarian right now",1.0
"
With regard to earlier line opportunities in prostate that the exploration being done by some others has recently started studies combining their PARP inhibitors with, for instance, abiraterone or enzalutamide",-0.2
"We will start a combination study with enzalutamide before the end of this year in collaboration with a number of investigators, we’re already effectively signed up for this",0.2
"
So I think that in the event, there is an opportunity to combine a PARP inhibitor with an enzalutamide or abiraterone or one of the next-gen products, we will be competitive in that space in a reasonably similar timeframe to the other trials that are seeking the same indication",0.1
"
Michael Schmidt
Understood",0.2
"Great, thank you",1.0
"And then on lucitanib, I think you did mention initial data presentation sometime this year",0.0
"I’m just wondering if you could help us understand a bit more, which of the trials and what indications and how many patients worth of data should be expected here by investors",1.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
Yes",0.1
We’ll submit to a number of meetings,0.0
"The one, I think we’ll probably that always seems to worked to the Clovis calendar, I don’t know why",0.0
"But the one where I would kind of focus you is most likely to be ESMO, which is this year in early September",0.0
"
We – I hope we certainly will have a dose and so a Phase 1 data set for safety, but we’ll have efficacy data anecdotes from that initial Phase 1 population",0.9
I hope we’re able to show data from a cohort size to be determined of patient from our gynecological study that will have some maturity,1.0
"
And at the defined go-forward Phase 2 dose and with a particular focus on endometrial cancer is where it absolutely going to be a cross-trial comparison, so that’s not perfect",-1.0
"But I know that people will be comparing whatever data we begin to generate in endometrial to with a 37%, 38% response rate in the label for the combination of pembro and lenvatinib
Michael Schmidt
Right",0.1
Thank you for taking the questions,1.0

Patrick Mahaffy

Operator
Your next question comes from Paul Choi from Goldman Sachs",0.0
"
Paul Choi
Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking our question",1.0
"I have two, one is commercial and one is financial",0.0
The first question is just on the commercial side,0.0
"As you look ahead toward prostate here, can you maybe comment on how you’re thinking about initial discounting in that category or – and/or patient assistance",0.0
"It’s a little bit down the road, I recognize",0.0
"So just maybe some early thoughts there, and how you can maybe improve formulary access or position for Rubraca there",0.9
"
Patrick Mahaffy
We haven’t given much thought, if any, to discounting in the prostate world",-0.3
"I think that we’re coming into a market where, yes, there we will be two of us, but there’s a pretty significant amount of interest in the class and willingness to use the class",0.9
"I don’t think that we’re going to have any issues related to formulary access with Rubraca, especially there’s only two drugs likely to be approved of the class in the indication",-0.2
"So from a discounting standpoint, I don’t really perceive a need",0.0
"
Paul, the second part of your question, again, sorry, I lost in my answer for the first",-1.0
"

Anna Sussman
Patient assistance",0.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
Patient assistance",0.1
Sorry,-1.0
"
Paul Choi
Yes",0.1
"
Patrick Mahaffy
I would imagine with patient assistance, you’re going to see a similar dynamic, where for Medicare patients, whose co-pay is not supported by foundations and foundations do exist and do support co-pays for prostate cancer patients with Medicare, that it would be a dynamic similar to that, which we’ve seen in ovarian, where we would effectively supply free drug for that percentage of Medicare patients who cannot access co-pay support from the foundation and who meet a certain financial threshold that means that we should not require them co-pay",-1.0
"
Just to reiterate what I think all of you know, we are not allowed to provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients",0.0
So that’s why the foundation support or us supplying the free drug as we do in ovarian is going to be a part of the mix,1.0
"
Paul Choi
Okay",0.2
Thanks for that,1.0
And my second question is financial and more strategic in nature,0.0
"And I guess, Pat, the cash guidance to second-half of 2021 is exclusive of any potential repayments of you outstanding 2021 convertible $97 million",0.2
"So I guess, ahead of that, what is the appetite for potentially doing either a strategic review or thinking about some sort of restructuring or reorg of the business",-0.4
Thanks for taking our questions,1.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
Yes",0.1
"I think that we – as I noted and Dan noted in our prepared remarks, we’ve reduced our cash burn pretty considerably",-1.0
We’ve reduced the planned trials that we had intended,0.0
"We’ve managed very modest, both year-over-year in headcount and are getting good – tremendous amount of work out of the people we have, including allocating people now to the new FAP program",1.0
"
I do think there’s likely to be a possibility of some form of refinancing those September 2021’s in a non-cash way, as we have successfully done in the past with other bonds",0.0
"So while I don’t have anything to announce today, I’m optimistic that over time, we’ll be able to do something on a moving forward basis to is non-cash",0.8
"And I think that you will see not only do we get into the second-half of 2021, if we’re able to do something to refinance those bonds, our net use of cash is going to continue to go down over the next several years",0.0
"
Paul Choi
Thanks for taking our questions",1.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
You bet",0.4
"
Operator
Your next question comes from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America",0.0
"
Tazeen Ahmad
Hi, good afternoon, Pat",1.0
Thanks for taking my questions,1.0
"Just to keep focus, I guess…
Patrick Mahaffy
Good afternoon, Tazeen",1.0
"
Tazeen Ahmad
…how are you",0.3
"Just to keep focus on…
Patrick Mahaffy
I’m good",1.0
"
Tazeen Ahmad
…on prostate cancer as we approach your PDUFA, I just wanted to get a better sense about how you’re thinking about commercial strategy as it relates to detailing oncologists versus urologists",-0.9
"This was one dynamic, I think, that you have been discussing leading up to the filing",0.1
"I don’t know, as we get closer, if you’ve changed your view on which specialists you’ll be focusing on initially, or if you’re trying to do both oncologists and urologists at the same time",0.0
"And then I have a follow-up question on ovarian, if I may",0.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
Yep",0.9
So the majority of our detailing and I believe that the majority of patients treated and of our sales are going to be through the medical oncology community,-0.1
"There are a group of urology practices called LUGPAs, which kind of is easy, it stands for large urology group practices, many of whom are of which have become fairly large and have become fairly good at continuing to treat their patients with multiple different therapies, including, in many cases, abiraterone and enzalutamide",1.0
"
Some of these practices have even brought into their practice, medical oncologists, so that they can treat and manage any side effects associated with those agents or with chemotherapy",-0.2
And they would certainly be able to manage delivery and any management of side effects of Rubraca,0.0
We think that probably represents somewhere around 15% of the men who probably would be treated and the remainder would be by the medical oncology community,-0.1
"

I had the opportunity to meet with a number of KOLs at ASCO GU in San Francisco, and they very clearly want the opportunity to manage the patients and – with Rubraca",0.4
"So I think it will be more in the medical committee than in urology, except for these very sophisticated large practices",0.1
"
Tazeen Ahmad
Okay",-0.4
So do you feel like your sales force is right-sized for that focus,0.9
"And if you do deem as this launch progresses that you want to have more contacts with urologists, would you need to hire more folks for that",0.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
I don’t think so",0.0
"I think in any event, we want to gain experience over a period of time with these LUGPAs before we would even consider moving on to a broader community-based urology community",1.0
So I don’t think anything is likely to move us in that direction too early in the launch,-0.1
"And yes, I do believe and we’ve looked at this extensively that we’re right-sized to support our current indications, as well as to launch in the prostate",1.0
"
Tazeen Ahmad
Okay, thanks",1.0
"And then for your originally approved indication in ovarian, can you tell us whether the penetration that you’re looking to get now is to get the doctors who have been prescribing to prescribe more, or is most of your efforts being placed on trying to get new docs who have not yet prescribed Rubraca",-0.2
"
Patrick Mahaffy
So it’s both",0.0
We do know that physicians often develop their own unique algorithm for whom they want to treat in the maintenance setting and for whom they want to continue with observation,0.2
And we very much want that algorithm to evolve to – maintenance is a really good idea for every women who has got recurrent ovarian cancer and they should be treated with Rubraca,-1.0
"
So we very clearly want to find those physicians who gained experience with Rubraca in a subset of their patients to then expand that subset to everyone, who qualifies for the indication and for the drug",0.1
There are a number of practices that still have not treated women with recurrent ovarian with the PARP inhibitor or have not treated a patient with Rubraca as their chosen PARP inhibitor and we are very much focused on those practices as well,-0.6
"
Tazeen Ahmad
Okay",-0.4
Thanks,1.0

Patrick Mahaffy
Thanks, Tazeen",1.0

Your next question comes from Andrew Berens from SVB Leerink",0.0
"
Andrew Berens
Hi, good evening",1.0
Thanks for taking my questions,1.0
I have a couple on [indiscernible] and then one on prostate,0.0
"I guess, could you give us a little more detail about the HRR screening that you’re doing in that trial",0.0
How does it differ from the repair deficiency testing that was done in the ovarian trials,-0.9
And any color that you can give us on the prevalence in the different tumor types would be appreciated,0.9
"
And then just also, what type of response rates would you need to see in the different tumor types",-0.8
How should we think about the benchmarks that the FDA would be looking for,0.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
Yes",0.1
"Well, the testing is pretty straightforward",0.9
"It is five genes that are tested using a panel from Foundation Medicine, looking at both germline and somatic mutations of these five genes",0.0
I don’t think we’ve announced the five genes,0.0
I don’t mind – I think it might even be available on clinicaltrials,-0.1
gov,0.0
But the most relevant of the five are BRCA1 and BRCA2,0.0
"
The tumor types that we are looking at are all solid tumors",-0.8
"We haven’t announced, again, those tumor types, but you can imagine that it includes pancreatic, that includes a subset of breast cancer patients",-1.0
It will include bladder,0.0
"It will include some other tumor types, where to your earlier question or to the – well, a part of your question, where the percentage of patients might be in the 2%, 3%, 1% range",-0.9
"But remember, the idea here is to enroll around 100 patients from around five different tumor types",-1.0
"And so the number of patients per tumor type is going to be, if you average it out, around 20",-0.7
"

So that the number we’re looking for is not a big number in order to satisfy the discussion that we had with FDA",-0.1
"We are aware that these are going to be, as is often the case, a more later line patient population",0.0
"And in each case, the data in the BRCA population is likely to be approved and I’m talking about response rate, Andy, to whatever is a later line standard of care for those patients, not limited to BRCA-mutated patients, but to whatever is available and approved in that patient population",0.5
So it will vary by the tumor type,-0.7
"
Andrew Berens
Okay",-0.3
"And then I’m just sorry, what would be – in the different tumor types for those five mutations, what percentage would it be the commercial opportunity, approximately",-1.0
"And I’m sure it ranges, but are we talking about same as prostate or more like ovarian cancer",-1.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
One of the things we’re trying to get a handle on is, as is true for ovarian and is definitely true in prostate is, is it also true that in these other tumor types in the more advanced patients that the incidence of somatic mutations increases, whether there’s either some form of enrichment or some reaction to prior therapies",-1.0
"
So I think what I would do is, say, it’s not going to be the 12% that you would see in prostate, it’s not going to be the 25% you would see in ovarian",0.0
"I think, you need to think of sort of mid single digits as a fair approximation across all of these other solid tumor types",-0.7
"So 4% or 5%, somatic and germline, feels like a reasonable average",1.0
"
Andrew Berens
Right",0.8
Okay,-0.8
And then just a quick question on the prostate market,0.0
"if – obviously, Lynparza is under review and their label and their data included patients that were BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM",-0.1
I guess what’s your sense about whether AZ will get ATM on the label,0.0
"And if they do, what do you think the commercial implications are for Rubraca",0.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
Gosh, we never talk about that here",0.5
"
Andrew Berens
Sure",0.1
"
Patrick Mahaffy
It’s really interesting",1.0
So the number of physicians who had experience treating ATM patients with PARP inhibitors will believe PARP inhibitors helped ATM patients is vanishingly low,0.8
"And the response rate data, as you’ve seen now across multiple studies is in the 10% to 12% response range, not the 45% to 50% that you see in BRCA",-0.1
And so it just isn’t as reactive a patient population to a PARP inhibitor as it is in BRCA,-0.1
"
The reason I can’t answer your question is, yes, I saw that they have shown the data for the mixed population of BRCA ATM patients, and in my memory, it’s around 7",0.0
5 months versus around 4,0.0
"5, five months",0.0
So they clearly hit the endpoint,0.0
"They showed us the median PFS for the ATM, BRCA and other subset populations",0.0
"But we’ve never seen a Kaplan-Meier curve for ATM patients broken out independently, including in the update they showed at ASCO GU",-1.0
"
And the reason that is so important is that’s going to be a more relevant way to determine whether there’s any evidence of activity versus their control arm, and their control arm isn’t even standard of care",-0.9
They didn’t allow chemo in the control arm,-0.4
They only allowed second-line enzalutamide or abiraterone,0.0
So I think it has to be looked at with even more of a grain of salt,0.0
"
So we’re kind of on the fence about whether they get it – not that it matters what matters is what FDA thinks",0.0
"But in the debate we had internally, we sometimes think, because we’ve been told so many times in our studies, yes, you can group them all together, but we’re going to look at the individual contributions by mutation or by HRD status or whatever is they’re looking at",0.0
And I would guess that they would have heard the same thing,0.0
"
As to what it means commercially, I don’t think it will change things if they get ATM and we’re limited to BRCA",0.0
"In the short-term, people will run their test and they’ll determine what – which of the agents they want to use, whether it’s ATM or BRCA patients",0.0
"Obviously, it does have ramifications for us",0.0
"We’ll complete enrollment in TRITON3 in a year or so, and that obviously did enroll ATM patients, as well as BRCA patients",0.0
"

And so what’s sauce for goose is sauce for the gander story, I’m kind of rooting for them to get ATM, because I believe then that we would have a high likelihood of getting ATM ourselves out of the TRITON2 study, which would expand our population from the TRITON2 label as soon as we get it from the 12% to 13% we see now to a total of somewhere between 20% and 25% of prostate cancer patients",0.8
So it would be an advantage for us to have it,0.1
"And so if they get it, I would be optimistic that we would do",0.6
"
Andrew Berens
Okay",-0.3
Thanks for answering all the questions,1.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
One of the things that was interesting, again, as we think about choice is, our understanding from the trial is that their assay required a biopsy",0.9
"They did not use a plasma-based assay in the PROfound trial, and our understanding is they did not work with a plasma assay company to go back and reevaluate their data",-0.8
"
So they’re going to come out marketing, but their label is going to require them to get a biopsy",0.0
"If you use archived data kind of as we discussed before, you’re going to get archived tissue, you’re going to be able to identify the germline mutations, but you’re going to miss a ton of the somatic mutations, which really do emerge over the course of the progression of the disease",0.1
"We, of course, are using a simple-to-use plasma assay",0.0
I actually think that’s going to be a real advantage when we get out into the marketplace,0.2
"
Andrew Berens
Okay",-0.3
Thanks,1.0
I appreciate all the color,1.0

Your next question comes from Ed White from H",0.0
C,0.1
Wainwright,0.1
"
Edward White
Hi, thanks for taking my call – my questions",1.0
So just a couple of quick ones,0.0
"Pat, can you tell us anything about the duration of patients being on drug in second-line maintenance",0.0
Have you seen some improvement there as well,1.0
"
And then also just on the second-line ovarian maintenance market, do you – you’ve sort of encapped that the 35% to 45% penetration level",0.0
And just wanted to get your thoughts on European penetration levels,0.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
Yep",0.9
Duration is in the 7 to 7,0.0
5-month range,0.0
So we’re pleased with this and about 85% to 90% of our use remains at the 300 milligram dose,1.0
"And so that speaks not only to duration, but the tolerability",0.0
So I’m really – we’re really pleased with the progress we’re making there,1.0
"
In Europe, it varies a little bit by country and the adoption has been in this 45% range",0.0
"I will say, it may just be from not having quite the experience our U",0.0
S,-0.1
"crew has had, but they like we did in the U",0.2
S,-0.1
"So I’ve heard from the opinion leaders that maintenance now is going to be broadly adopted over, because it’s approved and there will be far more use of maintenance beyond the early use in the BRCA patients, because that’s where olaparib was first approved in maintenance",-0.1
"
So it remains to be seen",0.0
"But right now, you should be thinking of penetration and adoption is being similar in Europe as it is in the United States",0.0
"
Edward White
Great",1.0
"Thanks, Pat",1.0
"And then just on the patient assistance program, you did go from 28% in the fourth quarter last year down to 18% in the fourth quarter this year",0.0
Just wanted to get your thoughts on the trend for 2020,0.1
"
Patrick Mahaffy
It’s a little early the trend at 2020",-0.9
"We thought when we had this call, our Q1 call this year, which would have been in May, that the Q1 number, which was good, it was 19% or 20%, I think, Dan, was going to be our best quarter, because Q1 were the Foundations we thought would have their most funding and it continued to come down over the course of the year",1.0
"Now there is some continuing funding of the Foundations, which do provide the support",0.7
"
But as we have noted on several of these calls, we have sharpened our review for the patients by referring everybody to an SP who will then conduct an investigation of insurance and what they’re able to afford, that – which has caused no eligible patient not to get the drug",-0.5
"We continue to provide free drug, but we have found through a better investigation that we can tighten our controls, and that has contributed to a lower percentage of patients on the PAP",1.0
"

Edward White
Okay, great",1.0
"Thanks, Pat",1.0

The last question comes from Gena Wang from Barclays",0.0
"
Gena Wang
Thank you for taking my questions",1.0
"Just wondering, Pat, do you anticipate any seasonality for first quarter 2020",0.0
And also EU revenue seems like had marginal growth,0.9
Any additional color you can give in terms of reimbursement and future revenue contribution,0.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
In Europe",0.0
"
Gena Wang
Europe, yes",0.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
Okay",-0.3
"So seasonality in Q1, I don’t – I think, we probably saw a little seasonality with the holidays in Q4",-0.1
I don’t anticipate a lot of seasonality in Q1,0.0
"Q4, we did see an impact of the Christmas season, to a far lesser extent, Thanksgiving, but definitely Christmas",0.3
So I don’t think there’s going to be much seasonality in Q1 that we can anticipate,0.0
"
With regards to reimbursement, you’re aware that in every country in Europe, once you’re approved, you negotiate reimbursement",0.0
We’ve successfully completed those negotiations now in every of the five major territories,0.5
"And we did see some growth driven primarily by German sales in Q4, some impact from the launch into the beyond the small private pay market in the UK in Q4, and we anticipate now continuing growth in Germany and the UK, but also, hopefully, growth coming from launches in France, Italy and Spain over the course of this year",1.0
"
Gena Wang
Okay",-0.1
"If I may, just one last question",0.0
I joined the call a bit late,0.0
"If already asked, I apologize",-1.0
"Just wondering, will you – when will you give a revenue guidance for 2020",0.0
"
Patrick Mahaffy
I thought I was going to get through this call",0.2
"Yes, Gena, somebody already asked that and I answered it",0.0
So we’re done,0.1
"No, last year, I think we gave it in the summer",0.0
"We do in the August call, is my memory, August – early August",0.0
"I’m not predicting that, but that feels realistic to me",0.0
We need to get our feet wet in the prostate market pending approval,0.1
And I’d like to see directionally how the launches are going in the EU before we would give a formal guidance,1.0
"So we have not done it yet, but I could see us doing it sometime in the middle of the year",0.0

Good morning, everyone",1.0
Thank you for joining the PostNL Conference Call for the Q4 and Full-Year 2019 Results,0.9
"With us here today, Herna Verhagen, our CEO; Pim Berendsen, our CFO",0.1
We will have an introduction by both after which there is ample time to ask questions,0.9
"Herna, over to you, please",0.1
"
Herna Verhagen
Thanks, Jochem, and I would like to start on Slide number 4, which is a slide with the key takeaways for 2019",1.0
"When we think about 2019, we did see very strong business performance in the fourth quarter, which gave a boost to revenue, but also to cash for the year",0.9
"The e-commerce now represents more than 50% of our revenue and is ahead of schedule, which is an important element in our strategy going forward",0.0
"
The underlying cash operating income came in at €167 million, which is at the high-end of our outlook",0.1
And I think especially worth mentioning is the fact that the full-year net cash from operating and investing activities was up €188 million from minus €19 million in 2018 to €196 million in 2019,-0.5
"Also, cost savings were at the guided range, €48 million, which is within the range of €45 million to €65 million",-0.1
"And important, of course, that next to preparations for the integration, Mail Netherlands also did their cost saving programs",0.9
"
If you think about our strategy being the e-commerce logistics player in the Benelux, there are a few very important steps taken in 2019",0.0
"The first one is, of course, the acquisition of Sandd",0.0
And I will come to that in a minute,0.0
But the network is fully integrated as of February 1 of this year,0.0
"
The second one is, of course, the improvements we made and the efficiency measures we took within parcels when it comes to creating the leverage between volume, cash and of course, EBIT",0.8
And then the divestment of our noncore activities,0.0
"Postcon last year today announced also the sale of Nexive, which is underpinning our focus on -- in our home market",0.0
"
Last but not least, ranked in the top 3 sustainable companies worldwide, in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and already 19% of our last mile delivered emission free and in our view, a very important element going forward",0.8
"
If you look into financials and that's on Slide number 5, then you find the most important financials over there",0.0
We saw a revenue increase of €72 million to €2,0.0
844 billion,0.0
"And the underlying cash operating income assets came in at the upper part of the bandwidth, a net cash already mentioned at €196 million",-0.1
"
Our proposed dividend for the full-year is the same as our interim dividend, which is €0",-0.1
8,0.1
The underlying cash operating margin within parcels was 7,0.0
"2%, within Mail in the Netherlands 4",-0.1
7% and the average of group was 6,-0.1
"2% and cash conversion in 2019 79%, free cash flow of €107 million on a normalized EBIT of €135 million, which is a cash version of 79%",0.2
"All by all the way we look into 2019, it's good year, its financially good year, very strong when it comes to net cash and cash conversion, and important steps taken when it comes to a sustainable future of PostNL",1.0
"
Stepping into our strategy and that's what you find on Slide number 6",0.0
"Of course, the ambition is to be your favorite deliverer and be the preferred logistics and postal solution provider in the Benelux region",1.0
"Importantly, that element is help customers grow their business, but also having reliable and accessible postal service, attracting and retain motivated employees, and in 2019, 88% of our employees were loyal employees, which means that they say we want to stay with PostNL, reduce the environmental impact",0.6
"I already gave you an example of 2019, and of course very important, deliver profitable growth and generate sustainable cash",1.0
"

For the profitable growth and sustainable cash there are two strategic elements of importance",0.6
"The first one, and that's the one you'll find on Slide number 7 is, of course, the leverage between volume, EBIT and cash within Parcels",0.0
"What you find on Slide number 7 are initiatives we've taken in 2019 to execute on that better balance and which, of course, will start to pay off as of 2020",0.6
And I'll come in a minute -- I will come to 2020 in a minute,0.0
"
To what did we do in 2019",0.1
What are the milestones important for that better leverage,1.0
"I think important was the fact that we opened three new depots in 2019 to be able to handle the peak, which we did see by the end of 2019, but also which gives us capacity for the year 2020",0.0
"We improved the utilization of the network by, for example, adding extra chateaus [ph] to our sorting belt, which gives us a better efficiency of the sorting centers and sorting belts",1.0
"
And we are preparing for the new small parcel sorting center",0.0
"That's what is mentioned on this slide on the left side as design SP S, small parcel Sorting center",0.0
"We designed, finalized the building leased",0.0
"First pilots -- we're doing first pilots in the building with partly robotized sorting and want to open the sorting center in 2021, and an important part of the efficiency going forward",0.2
"We also, of course, expanded the amount of electrical and green gas fleet in 2019 and are rolling out our city logistics program, because by 2025, we want to have 25 city centers in the Netherlands, which we will deliver emission free",0.9
"
The growth rate -- and also there I will give you a little bit more detail in a minute",0.0
Growth rate we did see in 2019 was 12,-0.1
4%,0.0
In the last quarter it was 10%,0.0
And we see that e-commerce market -- growth rate of the e-commerce market is slowing down,0.4
"
Important element in creating the leverage in parcels is also, of course, the commercial part or yield management where we did contract renewals, where we took up in our contract peak pricing, where we did an increase in single parcels price, we had indexation and we did price adjustments for parcels above both 23 kilos",0.0
"So the initiatives mentioned, and of course, mentioned at the Capital Markets Day in May are indeed implemented or started to implement",0.0
"They will partly pay off in 2020 and when it comes to small parcel sorting center, also we will pay off fail in 2021 and further on",-1.0
One important part of our strategy going forward,0.1
"
The second important part when it comes to profitable growth and of course, is generation of sustainable cash is what you find on Slide number 8",0.8
And that is the integration of PostNL and Sandd into one postal network,0.0
The acquisition of Sandd took place October 22 last year,0.0
There were lots of preparations already taken before October 22,-0.1
"And as of October 22, more than 30,000 calls and meetings have been taking place with employees",0.0
"
We had more than 180 openings of our depots to introduce people to do work with PostNL",0.0
We did lots of markets where people could find jobs within PostNL,0.0
"In the end, 4,300 new colleagues are welcomed last February 1",0.8
"We added around 30% more mail volume to our network and we added more or less 4,000 new customers",0.0
"
I think important in the integration is the fact that as of February 1, we have one strong nationwide postal network",0.0
The volumes are integrated and the people are integrated on the PostNL network,0.0
"And that means -- also means that as of February 1, we started to close down the network of Sandd, meaning the buildings, the cars, the bikes, etcetera, etcetera",0.0
"
Current network is 20,000 mail deliverers who work for PostNL and we deliver, of course, five days a week",0.0
"We have on average, 7 million letters per day",0.0
"We have 3,400 retail locations and more than 11,000 mailboxes in the Netherlands",0.0
So a quite successful integration in the first weeks of the integrated network and the integration of people works out very well,1.0
"

A little bit more information on our Q4 results, and therefore, I move to Slide number 9, starting with Parcels",0.0
"Parcels improved results compared to the fourth quarter in 2018 with €6 million, volume growth was 10% over the fourth quarter and the average over the full-year was 12",0.5
4%,0.0
"Of course, the effect, the growth also had a positive impact on revenue, which increased and it was a slight negative effect of negative price mix effect, which is mainly due to a shift in the international Parcels",-1.0
"
Also, results of Parcels improved in the last quarter, partly within our Parcels Benelux network, which was a positive effect of efficiency, slightly negative effect on price/mix",0.7
"We had an organic cost increase and, of course, as said, better operational efficiency",0.8
We had a good performance within logistics and Spring,1.0
They were off as well,-0.2
"
When it comes to results and I think we had a positive cash flow, it was up €10 million compared to Q4 2008, despite a higher CapEx and very much supported by a positive development of working capital, which we did see in general over PostNL in 2019",1.0
So volume growth a little bit below our expectation,0.7
Improvement in results -- good improvement in results and also very good performance on cash flow,1.0
"
When we come to Mail in the Netherlands and that's on Slide number 10, we did see good business performance partly because of the strong sales in peak season",1.0
So a good sale of the December stamp,1.0
"Volume declined in the fourth quarter, 9",-0.9
6% over the full year 9,-0.1
7%,0.0
And that is within the bandwidth we've given to the market,0.0
"And what we did see is that the delivery quality for the full year was 94%, a bit lower than we expected it to be and where it needs to be, which is mainly caused by, first of all, the fact that we had to adjust our sorting mechanisms to be ready for the volume of Sandd; secondly, first volumes of Sandd came in the last quarter of 2019, while the 4,300 people only came in as of February 1, 2020",-0.5
"
The results were partially, of course, impacted by the acquisition of Sandd, partly impacted again by substitution, which is no different from the other years",-0.5
Cost savings €10 million in the last quarter and the cost saving in total €48 million over the year,0.8
And also they are within the bandwidth,0.0
We've given €45 million to €65 million,0.0
"Also, cash up €13 million also here, mainly due to positive developments in working capital and less cash out for pensions and provisions",0.4
"
Well, we summarize the year 2019",0.1
"We do think very important steps made in the fulfillment of our strategy to become the e-commerce logistics player in the Benelux, around the integration of Sandd and around creating the initiative, which will create a better leverage between volume and Parcels, cash and, of course, EBIT",0.8
"And secondly, good results over the full-year when it comes to underlying cash operating income and very good results when it comes to net cash operating and investing activities",1.0
"
That, of course, raises the question of what does that mean for 2020",0.0
And what we would like to do is give you some insights in how we look into our potential in 2020 and what it does mean for the outlook,1.0
Starting with Parcels,0.1
"Of course, the main aim for Parcels in 2020 is improving the balance between volume and value and improving the balance between volume, cash and EBIT",0.8
"
What we do see is that the e-commerce market is slowing down",-0.1
"Still a market which is growing around a little bit above the 7% to 9%, which is our volume growth in 2020",0.4
So still a very strong growing market,0.4
"The 7% to 9% with PostNL is mainly because of the slowdown we see in e-commerce markets, and it has to do with the fact that we do see that some of our customers start to drive multivendorship, and that is a step down you see in the beginning of 2009 -- 2020, and we expect that in the next coming period we will follow market growth when it comes to Parcels",-0.7
"

The expectations when it comes to e-commerce market growth, as said, a little bit down compared to what we expected, but still very strong growth numbers",1.0
"Important in improving that balance is yield management, because what we tried to do is, of course, although we do see a little bit lower number in growth, we do want to create the leverage as we earlier discussed",0.9
How can we create a better leverage,1.0
"That's first of all, via yield management",0.0
"
Yield management means an improved pricing, which we do, for example, by the implementation of peak pricing, which will be implemented in Q4 2020",0.5
And that is on every parcel in the last six to eight weeks of the year,0.0
We will ask a certain amount for every customer delivering parcels to PostNL,0.0
"It also means a price increase for single parcels, which we did already January 1, 2020",0.0
It means adjusted pricing for parcels above 23 kilos and it also means indexation in our normal contract,0.0
So part of creating the better balance is via yield management,1.0
"
The second important part for why we do things that although we do see a little bit lower market growth and growth within PostNL, we do expect to increase our margins is via creating a better balance between volume and capacity",1.0
"Volume and capacity means that if we think about the network we have in the Netherlands, we think it will be possible to face the opening of a new depot from 2020 to 2021",0.0
So we adjust the network to the volume growth we see,0.2
"That’s, of course, a positive effect on the cash conversion in parcels",0.9
"
Second thing we do is when it comes to the small parcels sorting center, which will help us, of course, to create efficiencies is we're testing in 2020 for the small parcel sorting center to open it in 2021",1.0
"It's not only phasing in the opening of our depots, it's also measures to improve the efficiency",0.7
"
And what do we do to improve efficiency",1.0
"First of all, we improve the hit rate",1.0
And that means the -- when we come to your door that you open the door and we're not informed of a closed door,-0.2
"Hit rates improvements can be done, for example, via the app, in which we already have 5",0.0
"3 million consumers, but also drop duplication",-0.1
"A growth of 7% to 9% of on 283 million parcels, which was the amount of volume by the end of 2019, also means that you have more parcels per household",-0.1
"Secondly, we opened three new sorting centers in 2019",0.0
"That means when you add volume in 2020, you make, of course, the sorting centers we have today more efficient",1.0
"
Better peak balancing",1.0
"It's what we did together with the branch by the end of 2019 in an advertisement campaign in which we asked consumers to, of course, order earlier, but it's what we do daily, it's what we do weekly and it's what we do in seasons",-0.1
"We invest in the digitization to serve customer needs further and to create a digital supply chain, which allows us to have better supply chain management, but also to be better able to understand when you are at home, when you are not at home",1.0
"And I'll come back to that in a minute, because we will do in 2020 some extra investments above the normal investments than we have in digitization",0.0
"
And we improved as already said, the utilization of the current depots, of course, by smarter use of our sorters, but also by adding shooters to our sorter and efficiency will go up because we have more parcels through the same amount of parcel sorting centers",1.0
"So everything is focused on improving the balance between volume, cash and EBIT",0.6
"And that's also what translates in the end in the normalized EBIT of parcels in 2020, which shows an increase compared to 2019",0.0
"Same for, of course, cash",0.0
That’s Parcels,0.0
I think that's an important element,0.0
"
On Slide number 14, you'll find the picture of the new small parcel sorting center, as I said, we will open it in Nieuwegein, will be opened in 2021",0.0
"It will be more efficient, partially because it's only a sorting center, which means that you can use it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week",0.8
It's not connected to delivery,-0.6
"Secondly, it's also more efficient because it's highly automated and we're testing robots already to make this partly -- automated and partly robotized process",0.9
It will be used for the small parcels and small parcels is everything which is no bigger than a shoe box,0.0
"And 40% of the volume we currently have in our network is already smaller than shoe box size, which is an example of how we create efficiency",0.0
"

Then over to Mail Netherlands, which is on Slide number 15",0.0
Also familiar in the Netherlands focus on getting the efficiencies out of the integration of the two networks,0.1
That's one,0.0
"And secondly, of course, move forward with our cost saving plans",0.9
The assumed volume decline for 2020 is 8% to 10%,-0.1
I think important to understand that there is an impact of almost 1% of no election scheduled in 2020,0.0
So that's what you’ve to deduct when it comes -- if you want to make it comparable to 2019,0.0
"
We start with a higher base, and that is what you find -- sorry, in the graph",-1.0
"You find a volume of PostNL, added, of course, the volume descends",0.0
"So our starting point beginning of '20 -- end of 2019, beginning of 2020 is a higher level",0.0
Sandd adds 30% of volume to the volume we have,0.1
"Of course, as of that point, substitution will roll on and substitution in 2020 is expected to be, I said, between 8% to 10%",0.0
"
If you want to offset volume decline, it's the way we do it and we did it also over the last few years is by moderate price increases",0.0
To single mail is increased 4,-0.2
"6% as of January 1, 2020, bulk mail is also well above inflation and moderate",0.9
"And of course, we start gradually integrating the products of Sandd and we will respect the existing client contracts",0.0
This is part of how we offset volume decline,-0.1
"
The second part of offsetting volume decline is, of course, via further implementation of cost savings",-0.1
And that's what you find on Slide number 16,0.0
"So as said, our starting point as of February 1 is 30% plus in volume",0.0
"We've added and welcomed 4,300 employees of Sandd",0.9
"We added 4,000 new customers",0.0
And it will be delivered via one network,0.0
"
So how are we going to create cost savings going forward",0.0
"Partly, of course, because what we already did",0.0
"Overhead reduction, we will continue overhead reduction in line with our volume decline, centralization of locations",0.1
So we will move forward on the trajectory we're already in for many years to combine more and more locations and create scale,0.0
"And of course, also by closing down the network of Sandd, which means that the buildings of Sandd are already closed, vehicles are set apart, the same for their IT systems, etcetera, etcetera",0.0
So that's also part of the synergies,0.0
"
Another important step in 2020 is the next phase of our new mail route",0.0
"In the next phase of our new mail route, we are going to optimize our sorting and processes by automation",0.0
We will expand the routes,0.0
"We will create larger contracts for our mail deliverers and part of the delivery will be done by e-bikes, which enables people to take up more value in their mail route",0.0
It's an important part of cost saving or an important underpinning of the cost savings of 2021 and forward,1.0
"
So integration successfully managed",0.7
"First weeks are to -- at least our satisfaction, very much okay, on plan to deliver on the KPIs, as said last year, February 2019, and of course, already active with the implementation of further cost-saving plans",0.7
The third important filler under 2020 is the acceleration in digitization and innovation with extra investments,0.0
And it's an extra investment above the amount we already invest in 2020,0.1
"
The acceleration of digitalization, there we will capitalize on the value of our growth platform and our app in which we have 5",0.7
3 million users,0.0
How can we do that,0.0
"For example, by having even better receiver preferences than we have today, so that we know exactly when you want to have your parcel at what time and where, consumer in control, it improves our hit rate, which is an efficiency measure",1.0
"And on the other hand, it improves customer satisfaction because you do have your parcel at the moment you would like to have it",1.0
"But also tracking, for example, your deliverer, so that you have precise information on delivery, but also understand how many stops a driver still have to do before he's at your door",0.0
It reduces and that's what we've seen in pilots,0.0
"It reduces time at the door, which is again an efficiency measure",0.0
"And it, of course, again, also increases customer satisfaction because the feeling of being in control becomes bigger than it was",-0.1
"

And we use digitization to further optimize our supply chain",0.0
"For example, via, of course, adding our platform to the platform of others, but also creating a better supply chain in our own organization, creating more efficiency",1.0
"With all the data we have, with all the parcels we have, combining those data can deliver, for example, a more efficient transport chain than we currently have",1.0
"So the acceleration of digitization, in our view, is crucial when it comes to on the one hand, gaining -- further gaining in efficiency, and on the other hand also gaining in customer satisfaction",0.6
"And we will, of course, speed up the investments in the digitization",0.0
"
The fourth pillar underpinning our strategy 2020 is our environmental, social and governance roadmap, where, of course, we want to improve on the percentage of green delivered emission free last mile kilometers, which we will do, for example, by adding more electrical vehicles, but also adding biogas vehicles where possible",0.4
We want to improve the employee engagement,0.9
"We're very happy with the fact that 88% of our people are very much willing to stay within PostNL and having that stable workforce is crucial going forward, because part of the efficiency also comes from the knowledge parcel and mail deliverers have and highly satisfied customers, hopefully -- also the extra investment in digitization will help to improve the number of highly satisfied customers",1.0
"
And on Slide number 19, you find an example of how we improve our environmental footprint by 2025",0.8
"We want to have emission free delivery in 25 cities in the Netherlands, and in 2019 we added Nijmegen in December 2019",0.8
We added The Hague in January 2020 and we were already active in Groningen and Leeuwarden,0.0
But in our few crucial for -- it's a license to operate going forward as well,0.0
"
If we think about 2020 and that's what you find on Slide number 20",0.0
"We see an improvement in normalized EBIT within parcels from €120 million in 2019 through like-for-like €125 million to €145 million in 2020, mainly underpinned by the efficiency measures we're taking and the yield management",0.4
"Of course, we do have an impact of the new labor regulation, the Wet Arbeidsmarkt in Balans, that's an impact of around €10 million",0.0
"That means that the indication for parcels normalized EBIT 2020 is €151 million [indiscernible], still an increase compared to 2019",-0.1
"Also with the Mail in the Netherlands, we expect to increase our normalized EBIT €52 million was the result of 2019",-0.1
"We expect it to be in 2020, €50 million to €70 million, and there you see the first positive effect of the synergies created by the integration of the Sandd network",0.7
"
In PostNL other, we have an impact because of pension expenses, which is €25 million higher than it was in 2019",-0.3
Normalized EBIT for the group €135 million in 2019,0.0
If you make it like-for-like also there an improvement for 2020,1.0
"And if you add the extra cost we have because of pension expense and the new labor markets regulation, the outlook we give for 2020 is €110 million to €130 million",-0.2
"And as said, the underlying business performance for parcels and Mails in the Netherlands improves compared to 2019",0.9
"
In free cash flow, you do see a number €315 million to €285 million negative",-0.9
That includes final payment we have to do to the pension fund on transitional plans of maximum €300 million,0.0
And you find the word maximum over here because we're in discussion with the pension fund to find a different solution to this payment that can mean the payment in total will be lower than what you see over here,0.9
It also can be -- that it will be differently phased,0.0
"
So year 2020, where we do feel comfortable when we think about what we have to do within Parcels and Mail in the Netherlands, and an outlook which like-for-like improves on group level for PostNL",0.9
"

And I will give over to Pim for the financials",0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Yes",0.0
"Thank you, Herna First and foremost, we'll look at our Q4 performance full-year '19 with the key takeaways on that, and then look forward towards the 2020 key metrics",0.6
"
But first, to begin on Slide 22, the key financial takeaways",0.0
"I think important to note is the real improvement in net cash from operating and investment activities in the fourth quarter, up €32 million to €89 million",0.7
"And if you look at the overall improvement on cash flow in the year, it's an improvement of a €188 million, which is very, very significant and driven by an even better focus on working capital management, which will also continue going forward to ensure that we get the most cash conversion out of the profit we make",1.0
"
If you look at the revenue in the fourth quarter, revenue was up €49 million and the underlying cash operating income ended at 97 -- €79 million, I should say, €21 million below last year, of course, impacted also by the negative running result of Sandd and the initial costs related to that",-1.0
"All in all, ending the year at €176 million of online cash operating income is at the high-end of the bandwidth and something we are very, very happy about",0.9
"
You know that we've decided to change the financial metrics on which we will report",0.0
We'll go from UCOI to normalized EBIT to make the comparison to peers and the reconciliation between the different product profit metrics easier to follow,0.9
"And of course, you need to look both in terms of profit and in cash flow conversion that we have included a free cash flow metric, and particularly in the slides that will follow, I'll take you through the reconciliation of those elements to ensure that all of us understand how you get from EBIT to cash flow and how we look at the drivers going forward, influencing that",1.0
"
Sandd transaction completed on track",0.4
"We're really comfortable that it will give us the synergy potential that we've communicated, the €50 million to €60 million year-over-year synergies",1.0
Integration has started very well,1.0
"And as said, we're really convinced that we'll get to the synergies quickly",0.1
"And as Herna already said, let's say in the outlook, if you look at the guidance for the mail business going forward, you already see there that from 52 we expect to get to a €50 million to €70 million",-0.1
"And of course, in the past, we've always seen deterioration of profit in the mail business over the last years, particularly in the second part of 2020",-0.9
We'll see those synergies contributing to mails results,0.0
"
We've issued a Green Bond of €300million, also an important financial highlight in 2019",0.0
"If we don't look towards the key financial metrics in 2019, in line with the outlook we've presented, all the numbers on Slide 23 include the Sandd acquisition and there we ended the year on €176 million; UCOI, of which a €121 million parcels, €76 million in mail in the Netherlands",-0.7
And that particularly means an improvement in the Parcel segment and a deterioration in the Mail segment where we just talked about,-1.0
"
Then maybe important to spend a few words on the normalized EBIT definition",0.0
"The difference between UCOI and normalized e EBIT is particularly visible in Mail in the Netherlands because there remains, of course, the difference between when you create a provision for restructuring and the cash outs in relation to that restructuring",0.0
All normalization items are furthermore are the same,0.0
"So there is no other difference in the items that being normalized, but of course, cash versus when you take a provision is a deviation from the two profit metrics",-0.1
"
If we then go to the free cash flow for 2019, and we have created a €107 million of free cash flow for the year, which is a cash flow before acquisitions and before dividends and redemption of bonds or older financial activities, but it's after payment of lease payments",0.9
"So going from UCOI to cash flow, let's look at all the components of that bridge",0.0
"First, you have a reversal of one offs of €52 million, which basically falls into two buckets: one is the normalizations of approximately €60 million",-0.7
"And then on top of that, you've got a €32 million reversal of the final installment of the top up payments to be made",-0.2
And then there's a few other millions in there as well,0.0
"

Then you've got the depreciation and amortization at €180 million, which is up by close to €100 million, which is predominantly impacted by the IFRS 16 changes, as well as acceleration of appreciation -- of depreciation on Sandd assets of roughly €25 million",-0.4
"
Then CapEx was at €66 million in comparison to 2018 lower because in 2017 we opened two new depots of parcels through CapEx lines",-0.1
Important to note is the strong improvement,0.9
"On working capital, it's a €35 million investment in the year in comparison to significantly more than €100 million in 2018",-0.2
"Strong improvement on working capital management, which we expect to continue",1.0
"
Interest and taxes paid",0.5
"Well, nothing important to note there",0.1
"Disposals and other, €40 million, sale of buildings and a partial sell-down of the Whistl stake, for which we got a considerable cash amount",-0.4
"That brings to net cash from operating and investment activities to €169 million, deduct the lease payments of 62",-0.1
And basically countering the increase in depreciation in the top part of the graph that gives you the free cash flow for the year of €107 million,0.9
"
Then let's look at the impact of pensions on our financial statements that that's on Slide 25",-0.3
"And there I think it's important to -- there you see, kind of the provision for pension liabilities being to 83, pension expense of the year 119 and the regular pension cash out at a 111",-0.2
Two important elements to understand,0.0
"First, talk about transitional pensions",-0.1
"On the back of the agreement that was made in the past, the final payment for transitional pension is roughly €300 million",-0.1
That is based on coverage ratio and interest rates on an average in Q3 2019,0.0
"
Of course, those interest rates were at a very low figure, which impacted the size of this liability",-0.9
"We have initiated discussions with the pension fund to see if there are different ways to structure this final payment, and to see if we could lower the absolute amount without impacting the entitlements of individual employees that are entitled to this soft pension arrangements",0.1
"And basically, what we're seeking is an absolute decline of this number by, for instance, looking at using the interest rate of today and the ability to include expected returns that the fund will make on this payment as part of the way we calculate the base, and at the same time, we see whether or not we can face the payment slightly differently",-0.1
That should also have beneficial effects on the liquidity of this on the balance sheet,0.8
"
So basically two components we want to",0.0
It's capped at €300 million,0.0
It will never be more than that,0.0
We seek ways to limit it to a number lower than €300 million,0.0
"If we were, for instance, looking at the calculation on the back of the interest rate, at the first of January 2020, you would already look at a number which is roughly €20 million lower than the €300 million",-0.1
And the agreement that we're seeking will potentially have the option that if interest rates improve,0.4
"In this case, meaning increase, you'll see a further improvement on that finally, too, as being possible",0.9
"We seek to conclude those conclusion -- discussions in the first quarter of this year and next to seeking ways to limit the overall number asset we're also looking at ways to maybe phased payments, slightly differently from 2020 onwards",0.2
"
Next to that, another important element is the pension expense",-0.1
"That will be €25 million higher than 2020 or Herna, already talked about it when discussing the outlook",-0.1
The pension expense is based on IFRS accounting based on the interest rate at the end of the year,-0.1
The pension expense is being determined for the next year,-0.2
That €25 million additional pension expense does not lead to additional pension cash out,-0.7
"So it does hit your normalized EBIT, but it will not hit your cash flow statements",-0.3
I think important to understand,0.0
"

If we then go to Slide 26, spend a few words on the outlook there, we look at a normalized EBIT of the year 2019 of €135 million and on a like-for-like basis we see that improving to €145 million to €165 million",0.8
And it basically is driven by improvements both in Parcels and in Mail segments on a like-for-like basis,0.2
"So from a €145 million, €165 million, you will get on a like-for-like basis to a free cash flow of minus '15 to plus '15",0.8
"Of course to a large extent impacted by the Sandd acquisition and an increase in CapEx only, parcel side as we also communicated before",0.0
"
Now to get from the like-for-like towards the outlook of $110 million to $130 million",0.2
There was only two components that are in between dose,-0.2
One is the increase of pension expense I just talked about,0.1
So the €25 million negative impact on EBIT not hitting the cash flow statement and another one is €10 million impact as a consequence of change of labor regulation,-1.0
"The law was difficult to explain in English, but it basically means a higher cost for temporary workers that we need in our process is, particularly around peak and around night shifts in our Parcels business",-1.0
So that impact of new labor regulation is only visible in the Parcel segments,0.0
"
So that brings us to €110 million to €130 million, outlook 40 year on normalized EBIT",0.0
"And as said, minus 315 to minus 285 on free cash flow, including the soft pension payments to the fund based on the current agreements for which we seek to find an improvement",0.9
And we expect to be able to announce more than that before the end of Q1,0.0
"
What is important to note, if we talk about phasing of the 2020 numbers is that particularly in the first part of 2020, we still have more of the negative components of the Sandd acquisition visible in the results, meaning the integration cost, the volume will gradually come in, but there are still costs going to be made to wind down also Sandd network",-1.0
"So particularly, the contribution and the synergy effects of that acquisition will be visible in the second part of 2020, which means that the biggest part of the normalized EBIT certainly will be created in the second part",0.1
"And as you always know, Q4 will be the biggest quarter in any year and also in 2020",0.0
"
Then moving towards the Parcel segment on Slide 27, and what we've done, both in terms of EBIT '19 to '20 as well as cash flow, we've provided you with a better reconciliation, which is the same both for a Parcel and the Mail segment",0.9
"So if we look at the normalized EBIT from 2019 to 2020, there you see the key components: the revenue volume effect as a consequence of increase of revenue, which is driven by the 7% to 9% volume growth, a positive price mix effect as a consequence of the yield measures that we have introduced and said we would introduce slightly offset by negative mix effect, bigger customers are still growing faster than smaller ones",0.8
The organic cost increase here is related to the indexation towards our partners,0.0
"
Collective labor agreement increases as well as the impact of the new labor regulation we just talked about",-0.1
"The volume dependent costs are, of course, related to the increase in volume and the other cost development you see a combination of higher efficiency and older cost developments",0.5
"And the improvements of Spring and Logistics together, which brings us to the indication of normalized EBIT of €115 million to €135 million",0.1
"And then on a like-for-like basis, we add back the €10 million as a consequence of new labor regulation, which basically shows the improvement of the underlying Parcels business from a €120 million -- €225 million to €245 million",0.4
"
The same bridge on Slide 25 for the Mail business where go from the €52 million to $50 million to $70 million in the cash of normalized EBIT for 2020",-0.1
"There you see the volume effect €35 million to €55 million, additionally which is based on a 8 to 10 percent volume decline",-0.2
"And of course, that revenue number being impacted by the consolidation of Sandd",0.0
"Revenue price mix, the moderate pricing policy will continue",0.0
"Then organic costs are driven by the collective labor increases volume dependent costs, of course, influenced also by the additional volumes that we get from the sound acquisition and the other cost component -- here is the combination of cost savings and other efficiency related results, as well as restructuring charges of Sandd and other costs",-0.1
"

What is important to note that within that other cost bucket, we still include €35 million of cost savings, which is the cost savings that we originally had",0.0
Net of the delay on some of the implementations on these cost savings as a consequence sequence of the Sandd acquisition,-1.0
"If you remember, the way we presented the business case, we said initially there would be a delay of the implementation of certain cost saving initiatives because of the fact that we app all the Sandd volume to our network that leads to a different facing of those plans",-1.0
"
So net of that delay is €35 million included in the other cost development as cost savings for Mail in the Netherlands",-1.0
"And for your view, the kind of delay is roughly between €15 million and €20 million on the cost savings side",-1.0
"Then the other results impacted by the sale of PostNL Communications Services, the sale of Spotta and the results of other services, including the termination of our the unaddressed activities of the PostNL branded an address businesses in 2019",0.0
"
Then on Slide 29, we make a reconciliation of 2019 and 2020 normalized EBIT to adjusted free cash flow numbers to give you all the components that are relevant between EBIT and free cash flow",0.6
"Reversal of one offs, depreciation and amortization slightly down, given the fact that the 2019 number includes acceleration of depreciation on Sandd",-0.1
Some of the Sandd assets,0.1
"CapEx, as we already said before, will increase predominantly through a step up in parcels related to the preparations of the small parcel sorting center",0.0
We faced one of the depots to 2021 and also on the mail side there's additional investments required for the new mail route,0.0
Phase 2 process that will subsequently allow us to take cost out and to improve the efficiency in the mail network going forward,0.6
"In a change of working capital, the underlying working capital performance is continued",0.4
"The deterioration that you see here is completely because of above average settlements of terminal twos, a topic that we discussed a couple of times before",-0.7
"
So underlying development, no change",-0.5
We stick and continue to focus on improving that,0.9
The deterioration is wholly as a consequence of old terminal do positions that need to be settled in 2020,-0.6
"So let's say if you were to look at '20, '21 and beyond, that number will come down significantly back towards the 2019 change, your working capital ranges",0.0
Then change in pensions,-0.1
"If you see a plus '20 in 2019, the final payment of unconditional funding obligation was included, and of 2021, larger positive impact",0.8
Only the main pension plan will be the cash outs going forward,0.0
"
Change in provisions is a negative 30 for 2020",-1.0
We have created that provision in 2019,0.0
"That's, of course, one of the elements of the change from UCOI to normalized EBIT that you see here, the provision got created particularly for restructuring and the social plan in relation to send in 2019 and the cash will subsequently go out in 2020",-0.1
When we now have integrated the businesses or the volumes into PostNL's network,0.0
"
Sale of buildings and other divestments approximately €50 million interest paid and income tax €50 million, which brings us to the adjusted free cash flow of minus €15 million to plus €15 million",0.3
And the final payment of transitional plans of 300 million,0.0
"Then just to make sure, particularly this year, we -- where we make that change to normalized EBIT and free cash flow, that there is a proper understanding of the cash conversation in the -- cash conversion, cash generation in the segments, we've included bridges from normalized EBIT to cash flow for the segments as well",1.0
"
And I see the €115 million to €150 million of normalized EBIT for Parcels turning to a adjusted free cash flow of €40 million to €60 million for the year, before final payment of transitional plants and that is driven by higher CapEx, its slightly higher depreciation and amortization and lease payments that are up as well on the back of the increased investments in capacity",0.8
"So €40 million to €60 million out of a €115 million to €135 million, a normalized EBIT will be the free cash flow into any -- to any",0.7
"

Looking at the cash generation at Mail in the Netherlands",0.0
"Of course, those who are impacted by the Sandd integration and the final payment of transitional plants, the €50 million to €60 million -- €70 million leads to a minus 75 to minus 55, adjusted free cash flow, where, of course the biggest component relates to cash out on the restructuring of Sandd and the acceleration of settlement of big terminal do positions that out of the delta working capital we just talked about was kind of the majority of it",0.7
"Roughly €60 million to €65 million of that delta working capital relates to the final settlement on these terminal dues, which is a key component of the reconciliation to the minus €75 million to minus €55 million",-0.1
"
Going forward, as said, that settlement level on terminal dues will be significantly lower",0.0
"And of course, after 2020, we've done all the one-off cash outs in relation to the integration of Sandd that you would expect a big improvement on adjusted cash flow generation from 2020 to 2021 onwards, bringing it to positive cash flows",0.9
"
And as we said, one of the key components of doing the Sandd acquisition is getting to a stable, profit and cash flow from mail business going forward, which will be able to show as of 2021 onwards",0.8
We have decided to adjust our dividend policy to align it with normalized EBIT,0.0
The current dividend policy was based on a net profit number on the back of the UCOI profit metric,0.0
So the profit that was required or relevant for dividend calculation was based on the underlying net cash income,-0.1
"
But if you move to a normalized EBIT net metric, you also need to change the net profit metric on which you will base your dividend payments",0.0
"We've changed it to a normalized comprehensive metric, which is basically defined as the profit attribute to equity holders of the parents, adjusted for significant one-offs and special items, including fair value adjustments",0.8
"
Net effect",0.1
"So it basically follows the same normalization that we include in EBIT, but then just net of tax",-0.1
"Then a few other elements, no authority",-0.1
"In our financial framework, we clearly make the statement that we want a leverage ratio of not exceeding 2",0.0
0,-0.1
"We strive to get a credit rating, or triple B, triple B plus",0.0
That is part of our financial framework and we've amended the formulation of the dividend policy by referring to that financial policy in relation to the condition of distribution of dividends,0.0
So it's less black and white 2,0.0
0 in the dividend policy,0.0
"
It refers back to the financial framework where we still strive towards that same credit rating as ever before",0.0
We aim to pay dividends that develop substantially in line with operational performance and the payout ratio on the back of the normalized comprehensive income metric will be roughly between 70% and 90%,0.0
"If we were to apply this dividend policy through the previous years, you'll get the same dividend payout as we've had before",-0.1
So it doesn't lead to a fundamental change in dividend payouts,-0.2
"
We stick to the choice of cash or share of dividends, and the interim dividend is set at approximately a third of the dividend of the prior year",0.0
"And we expect to restore dividend payments within the 12 to 24 months off the closing of the Sandd transaction, as we said before",0.0
"
Then to conclude the presentation on Q4 numbers, there was clear -- clearly there what our key priorities are",0.0
"Once it capture the growth potential in the e-commerce development, we want to create a better balance between volume growth, profit growth and that local version from parcels, meaning that will seek to improve our operational leverage",0.9
"
We need to capitalize now on the synergy potential of the Sandd acquisition where we are very comfortable that we will realize the €50 million to €60 million structural synergies that we said before",1.0
"And well, that said, we aim to resume dividend payments within 12 to 24 months after closing of the Sandd transaction",-0.1
We keep on focusing on increasing the customer satisfaction and our employee engagement,0.2
"

And as we clearly stated before, we want to get to zero carbon emission last mile delivery in 2025 for the 25 biggest cities of the Netherlands and get completely emission free for the last model in 2030",0.9
And we want to do that by being the preferred logistic and postal solution provider in the benefit region,0.9
That concludes the presentation from both Herna and myself,0.0
And we can now open up for Q&amp;A,0.0

Question-and-Answer Session
Jochem van de Laarschot
Yes",0.0
"Thank you, Pim",1.0
And we have a number of analysts here in the room and a number of people on the line,0.0
"For those on the line, you can press ""*"", ""1"" to register your interest to ask a question",0.0
But let us start here in the room,0.0
"Looking around at the table, who would like to go for the first question, please",1.0
"
Lotte Timmermans
Lotte Timmermans, ABN AMRO",0.0
"First, though, your 2020 guidance in Parcels, the volume growth of 7% to 9%",0.2
"Do you also incorporate Amazon as stepping into the Netherlands, and what's your view on that for 2020",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
The -- in the guidance we gave for 2020 to 7% to 9%, it includes every market development and that means also including Amazon",0.0
"Of course, we did look into the other European countries to see what the impact of Amazon is -- it has been in those markets, because they are, of course, three to four years at the Dutch market",0.0
"What we see in most of those markets when Amazon comes in, they also have a positive impact on the growth in e-commerce",1.0
"So Amazon as a customer of us and their part, of course, when we think about future, the part of our future as well",0.1
"
Lotte Timmermans
Okay",-0.4
"And if you think about those splits, what I can't figure out what the splits of volume between DHL and PostNL",-0.2
Is that still the case,0.0
And can you indicate about how much is divided between the two,0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
No, no",-0.1
"Of course, many of our customers do [multiple speakers] the volumes over several distributors and we're not giving information on specific customers",-0.9
"
Lotte Timmermans
And on corona, do you see any impact from that",0.1
And what do you think is going to happen for 2020,0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes, we're following of course corona very closely",0.0
It does have an impact on international parcel streams from and to Asia with Spring were active in those areas as well,0.0
We do not expect that we will have a material impact in 2020 on the numbers of PostNL,-0.1
"
Lotte Timmermans
Okay",-0.4
Thanks,1.0
"And on this mail prices, they haven’t risen significantly since 2014 due to the competition of Sandd",-0.1
"Of course, this is now solved",0.8
"Transferring this contract to your own contracts, what kind of implications is it going to have, and is this going to be significant to 2020",-0.2
"
Herna Verhagen
I said we will follow moderate pricing increases going forward as well, so no change in that",-0.1
"We will, of course, adhere to the contracts customers have with Sandd in the past",0.0
"So in the overview, Pim gave, you can see what the price impact is in 2020",0.0
We do not expect to do something different than we did do over the last few years and we did said before,0.0
"
Lotte Timmermans
Okay",-0.4
Thanks,1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Thank you",1.0
"[indiscernible] 
Jochem van de Laarschot
Yes",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Okay, Henk",-0.6
"
Henk Slotboom
Henk Slotboom, the IDEA",0.1
"First of all, well, let's start with the nicher one",0.9
The delivery quality of mail dropped to 94%,-0.3
Does it have any implications for the side of ACM here,0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes, we don’t know",0.0
"Of course, we will come off with our formal evaluation in May",0.0
"What we do see, of course, is that the quality in 2019 was impacted by two reasons",0.0
"We changed our sort systems, our sorting -- the way we sort to be prepared for the volume coming in of Sandd",0.1
So that's one reason,0.0
"And secondly, we did see in the last quarter that already volume of Sandd came into our own network without the people who were only added as of February 1",-0.1
"What we do see is that from the moment that we have those 4,300 extra people, we do see, of course, increasing quality numbers in 2020",0.0
"So what the impact will be, I don't know",0.0
"But we do have, of course, good -- in my view, expectations on policy levels in 2020",1.0
That's one,0.0
"And secondly, everything is focused on getting above the 95%",0.0
And 2019 was an extra ordinary year,-0.2
"

Henk Slotboom
94% is over the full-year",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes",0.0
"
Henk Slotboom
So it means that in the last quarter you were well below that",0.8
"
Herna Verhagen
I said we were just around 95% when we did our Q3 numbers",0.0
Those numbers were published as well,0.0
"In the fourth quarter, we did see, of course, the impact of changing our sorting system",0.0
We did see the impact of the volume added by Sandd to it,0.0
"
Henk Slotboom
Okay",-0.5
Let's switch to parcels,0.0
I am looking at slide number 27,0.0
Now a couple of things that puzzled me,-0.9
"First of all, if I take a look at your revenue expectations and the delta of revenue on normalized EBIT, so its €75 million to €95 million, which is the equivalent of 4",-0.2
4% to 5,0.0
"6%, if I calculate this right",0.8
"That means that the balance will further shift towards larger clients, I assume of the mix",0.0
Now is that included in the price mix effect,0.0
That's in the 5% to 15% -- 5% to 15% price mix component,0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
If I take the 7% to 9% volume growth and relate it to -- I assume, all other things being equal, I assume, I relate that to the 60 and 72, you realized in 2019, I don't -- I mean it doesn’t add up",0.2
"It does, because that relates to the entire Parcel segment, of course",0.0
And the 7% to 9% growth is related to the domestic parcels business,0.6
"
Henk Slotboom
Parcels business, okay",-0.3
"
Pim Berendsen
And the added revenue growth is even slightly higher than the 7% to 9%",0.7
And there you see the implications or the effect gradually kicking in of that better balance between volume growth and revenue growth,0.9
"
Henk Slotboom
Clear",0.1
"I remember, let's go back to May of last year",0.1
"Pim, you gave the CAGR of 14% for the period 2018-2022",0.0
Is that correctly,-1.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Yes",0.0
"
Henk Slotboom
And now we see 7% to 9%",0.1
What has changed so dramatically in nine months time,-0.2
"
Pim Berendsen
A couple of things have changed",0.1
"And the biggest component of that change: a, is a slowdown of the overall market growth",-0.6
We've ended the year at 12,0.0
4% growth last quarter,0.0
2019 was 10% growth,0.4
That's predominantly driven by a lower market growth where you see certain categories becoming gradually more and more mature,0.7
I started the split between offline and online sales get to a level that those categories are getting closer to maturity,-0.1
"Let's not forget that a 12% growth or 7% to 9% growth is still very, very significant growth as you see a slowdown in market growth where new categories which are much smaller are growing faster, but they are significantly smaller than the bigger categories like fashion, like toys and electronics",1.0
So that is one component,0.0
"And particularly in 2020 the 7% to 9% volume growth is impacted by the fact that some of our customers go to a multi vendor strategy and that has its impact where we kind of lose a little bit of market share, which was also something that we did guide towards in Capital Markets Day because of that",-1.0
"So the 7% to 9% is also impacted to a little bit loss of market share because of that dual vendorship, which we subsequently expect -- so basically the growth go like this, step down because of dual vendorship to come to -- subsequently follow the trajectory of the market growth again",-0.5
"
Henk Slotboom
In a multivendor, you mean people going to the bol marketplace, selling through marketplace or bol …",-0.1
"
Pim Berendsen
But also because of peak constrained",-0.1
So what we said really strives to get to a better balance of volume growth and cash flow conversion,1.0
"We cannot just increase capacity for the peak in the year and period only, which basically means that some of our customers decided, okay, but then we need to ensure that we've got enough capacity to fulfill our growth and then they seek alternative distributors as well",0.5
"And because of that, they basically take a part of that market share because of that strategy change",0.0
"

Henk Slotboom
The first part of the multivendorship, what you say about choosing for somebody else next to PostNL to do the last mile",0.3
But let's go to the marketplaces of bol,0.0
The ball is now setting more than 50% of its sales is done in third-party products,0.0
"How much grip do you have on this other 50% -- on this 50% plus that is now a third-party product, because if it was bought, it would almost automatically lands at PostNL because you have a well established relationship with them",0.5
Same with Amazon,0.0
They also sell more than 50% of what they would have sold via Amazon is sold via the marketplace,0.0
How do you get any grip on it,0.0
Because this is the large volume that steps the SME volume or which you can fetch better pricing,0.9
"
Herna Verhagen
I think the grip you have on volume is, of course, via the services you deliver",0.0
It's partly the quality you can offer,0.0
It's partly the extra services you can deliver,0.0
"For example, via the app",0.0
"So there is, of course, lots what people want to -- still want to choose for PostNL",0.0
That's not different from platform customers as it is to other customers,0.0
"Part of the effect from platforms is of course, in the price mix effect as already said by Pim",0.0
"So it does have an impact on your price mix, but it is included",0.0
But I think the impact we do have on sending customers is because of the fact that we deliver highest quality,0.0
So we have lots of extra services that we can reach consumers better than everyone else in the Dutch or Benelux market,1.0
I think those are reasons why people still want to choose for delivering for PostNL,0.0
"
Henk Slotboom
Last on the price mix effects",-0.1
"Amazon coming in, everybody is looking at it",0.0
Lots of the -- has been written about it,-0.2
And you see two different developments currently in the market,0.0
"One is bull, which is, I think, more defensive in terms of pricing and seeking all sorts of arrangements for clients coming via its marketplace",-0.1
"And you’re the one is Coolblue, adding more people in [indiscernible] those kinds of things",0.0
"Is it fair to assume that the pricing element from the side of large clients like bol, like Coolblue, you mentioned it, will toughen if now that Amazon is knocking on the door here",1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
I think there is already or there has been already for many years, lots of competition in the Dutch market with the auto distributors in the Dutch market",0.1
So I don't think that will much change with the -- with Amazon arriving into this market,0.0
"What, of course, will change is there will be a third player in the market, assuming that they will step in",0.0
"etcetera, etcetera",0.1
"So there will be a third player in the market that will have, of course, its impact on who is going to be in which platform, who's going to sell via whom",0.0
"So that, of course, will have an impact",0.0
What you did see in the other European countries that has had a positive impact on the amount of e-commerce parcels,0.9
"So in that sense, it could be -- it could have a positive impact in the Dutch market when it comes to the amount of to be delivered process as well",-0.8
"
Henk Slotboom
I have two questions, then I will let floor to other people",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes",0.0
"
Henk Slotboom
One is, if I look at Amazon coming in, the bol has hands tainted in the fashion has entered into the fashion segment",-1.0
They have opened up its marketplace,-0.1
"Amazon, question is, will their key with 25 groups the labels",0.0
There is a competitor of yours and they realize at least 20% of the volume in a large former catalog seller,0.0
We've seen a lot of publicity about that one,0.0
"Not only that the results were not doing very well, but also about the call center",-1.0
There was a very interesting article,1.0
What happens if one of your clients or your competitor biggest clients goes out of business,0.0
How can that affect the market,0.0
"Because if somebody who's just 20% of the volume, they have to, yes, fight for other volume elsewhere",-1.0
How do you look at that,0.0
"

Herna Verhagen
You have a -- the assumption you take is the assumption that Amazon will win that volume",0.9
"So in that sense …
Henk Slotboom
But is that illogical",-1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
I'm not -- I don't know",0.0
"I think there are lots of scenarios written in newspapers, etcetera, what could the impact be of Amazon stepping into the Dutch market",-0.2
As far as we can see and that's the reason for saying in other European markets it had a positive effect on the amount of e-commerce,0.8
And maybe there will be changes in the market,0.0
"But I think when we are not the ones who are going to forecast those changes, that's where we will see",0.0
"The only thing what we assume is that we will be able with the services and prices we have, the people we have, the density of our network, is we assume, we will be able to keep the market share in the market as we have today",0.0
"
Henk Slotboom
Final question is, I had a look at the Coolblue report last week",0.0
"And if I see how many people they are adding in terms of delivery, in terms of the [indiscernible] handling as a service component, what you have as well, And they expect to deliver at least a million items CO2 free this year, which is triple the amount that the number they did last year",1.0
How -- just please illustrate that I know that a million parcels is peanuts when you compare it with the 300 million or so you're doing,0.0
"But isn't it illustrating that the competition on the last mile could toughen and that you get it -- whereas in the past, you were and you still, are the biggest one and you should be able to deliver in the most efficient way",0.9
What does this tell us about Amazon,0.0
Because Amazon does a lot of the last mile,0.0
"Look at Austria, for example, they've taken on the last mile themselves to deliver in Vienna",0.0
And I believe they are about to do within the results for that as well,0.0
Aren't you afraid that something like that could happen in the Netherlands as well,0.7
And how are you going to arm yourself against it,0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
I think the -- if you think about PostNL and the presence we have in the Netherlands, but also in Belgium, we already are quite armed in the sense that we do have a very efficient last mile operations",1.0
"We do come every street, every day, every door, that's what we already do with an app in which you have 5",0.0
3 million consumers in the Netherlands,0.0
"You add, of course, also lots of convenience to consumers as well",1.0
So never underestimate your competitors,0.0
That's not what I'm saying,-0.2
"But what I'm saying is that we already have quite some competencies to do the last mile delivery best in Netherlands and in, of course, Belgium",1.0
"The -- I think -- so in my view, there are lots of opportunities for PostNL as well",0.1
It's not only for us seeing the risk,-1.0
There's also lots of opportunities in what will change in the market,0.0
"
Henk Slotboom
Okay",-0.5
"
Herna Verhagen
And take into account that if you think about the other European countries before Amazon steps into last mile delivery, they do need quite some volume to create some density",0.0
And in the Netherlands they start at a certain point this year,0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
In a much more fragmented market, then I think the market in the U",0.0
K,0.2
", Italy or Austria is …
Herna Verhagen
Or Germany",0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
… or Germany, yes",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Also take the differences into account",0.0
"
Jochem van de Laarschot
Okay",-0.3
"Operator, can you move to the -- oh, sorry",-1.0
Can you move to the first one in line,0.0
"
Operator
Yes, sir",0.0
"The next question is from Marc Zwartsenburg, ING",0.0
"Go ahead, sir",0.1
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
Yes",0.0
Good morning and thank you for taking my questions,1.0
First on Parcels,0.1
"We saw quite a negative -- well, mix effect in Parcels in Q4",-1.0
"But if I look to your guidance going forward, you expect quite a strong positive pricing effect",0.9
"So I think also that, as Pim was mentioning, to see revenue growth above the 7% to 9% volume growth",0.7
Is that correct,0.5
"And can you give us a bit of an indication of those two building blocks, please",0.0
"

Pim Berendsen
Yes",0.0
"What I said is on the back of a question of, Henk, the 7% to 9% volume growth in relation to the overall revenue growth on the Parcel side, revenue and volume growth are coming closer and closer together, exactly as we pointed out before",1.0
Another is on the back of yield management measures that we have taken and they relate to several different elements,0.0
"One is a different pricing structure for the bigger parcels in the network that take, relatively speaking, too much cost capacity in sorting and delivery",-0.4
They will only get delivered at surcharges,-0.1
"Next to that, we have introduced peak pricing and peak levels for 2020",0.0
"And also on the back of a point that Henk made earlier, individual price points are moving up",0.0
"So when contracts expire, we seek to get indexation above and beyond, if possible, the inflation levels to improve the individual price points in these contracts to get us to the better balance of volume growth and profit growth",0.9
That price effect in itself is then still subsequently impacted by the negative mix effect because of their customers growing faster and/or smaller customers moving to platforms,-0.9
And the combination of the two leads to the €5 million to €15 million improvement from '19 to 2020,0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
And all the initiatives were taken or we have taken are in line with what we also communicated at Capital Markets Day in May",0.0
So what we did say by then is implemented by now and we will have its effect in 2020,0.0
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
And you say the balance leads to the EBIT increase, but how does it look on the revenue levels",0.0
I'm thinking now that we have a positive impact here,1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Correct",0.9
That’s correct,0.5
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
That’s correct",0.9
"
Pim Berendsen
Yes",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
That's correct",0.9
Yes,0.1
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
Okay",-0.5
"So the revenue growth in Parcels Benelux will be above 7% to 9% plus, so, to speak",0.1
"
Pim Berendsen
Yes, slightly above",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes",0.0
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
Okay",-0.5
"And then your expectation for market growth in '20, do you have any number for us to give a feel for how the e-commerce is developing",0.4
"
Pim Berendsen
Slightly above the 7% to 9%",0.0
That's what we expect in 2020,0.1
"And as already said, the 7% to 9% growth with -- within PostNL is caused by the fact that we see a multivendorship, which we expect is already when we did our presentation at Capital Markets Day, but you see it coming in beginning of 2020",-0.1
"So of …
Marc Zwartsenburg
Basically -- sorry, go ahead",-1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
So after that, our expectation is that growth -- volume growth within PostNL will be in line with market growth",0.9
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
And that's accelerating from these levels again, or …",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
At a certain point in time, yes",0.0
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
But you say slightly above …
Herna Verhagen
Above",0.0
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
… so you only expect a small impact from all your price increases, market share losses from your vendor etcetera",-1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes",0.0
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
Is it cautious enough, do you think, given what Henk was just alluding to",-0.1
"
Herna Verhagen
As far as we can see at this moment in time, the answer is yes",0.0
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
And then on mail NL",0.0
"Can you give us an indication of the contribution of Sandd excluding the restructuring charges for Q4, please",0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Excluding restructuring charges, the running performance of Sandd turned into a loss",-0.6
"Exactly, yes",0.1
"As we predicted, if you look at the Q3 quarterly presentation, we've shown that -- we've shown the kind of normalized EBIT level, including Sandd and excluding Sandd",0.0
And we also showed a kind of a deterioration as a consequence of Sandd there,-0.8
"So if you compare to that business case, there has been a loss of the Sandd business in Q4 as part of our normalized EBIT and/or e-com numbers or kind of the normal operating losses of Sandd",-1.0
"Above and beyond that, if you talk about EBIT, we've taken restructuring provisions on the back of the social plan that was agreed for people not joining us, so to say",-0.3
"And in a reversal of one-offs, you'll find acceleration of depreciation of roughly €24 million on assets of, let's say, the old Sandd that we will not use anymore because basically we migrate all the volumes to our network deploying our assets to distribute that volume",-0.1
"

Marc Zwartsenburg
And then a few for you, Pim",0.0
"On the investments, I think you mentioned also digital investments come on top of the guidance of the Capital Market Day CapEx",0.0
Is that correct,0.5
And how much is it in 2020,0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Well, on top of I don't know if that's what I said",0.4
"What I’ve is that if you look at the bridge from '19 to 2020, you'll see an increase in CapEx levels from €66 million to €120 million, which is a lower increase than originally assumed in Capital Markets Day because Herna clearly stated that we have the ability to phase those investments on the back of how growth develops",0.0
"And in that level, we have included roughly €10 million acceleration of digitalization that will help us in different ways",1.0
"One is to make the app even more relevant to increase the customer journey of the consumers by allowing them to follow their driver, but also allowing us to launch new service options to them",-0.1
"And at the same time, those digitalizations will help us in optimizing our value chains by becoming even more data driven than they already are",1.0
And that will of course contribute to the efficiency improvements that we seek and that will also lead to lower cost proposals,0.5
"The €10 million additionally included for digitalization is already in, yes",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
And in the CapEx number, which is lower than what we expected at Capital Markets Day because of phasing of expanding our capacity",-0.1
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
Yes, that was actually my second question",0.0
"On the €120 million, I think it compares a bit to the sale of the 45 at the Capital Market Day, if I'm correct",0.8
"But does it mean that the difference between the two and excluding the digital, so $110 million midpoint minus the 10s or €45 million less, is that on a phasing that goes into 2021",0.0
Or should we even face it more,0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Not all of it",-0.3
There's a few components,0.0
"Some of the step up in investments also relate to the mail business where we will have additional investments in the second round of the new mail route, partially",0.0
"So if we face a depot from 2020 to 2021, yes, obviously that investment will then subsequently move from '20 to '21",0.0
"At the same time, that also means that for 2021, as we have assumed, certain investment levels will again have the option to see whether or not those are required, given the current view on market growth",0.6
"
Herna Verhagen
And I think what remains of utmost importance for 2021 is the opening of our small parcel sorting center, because that will add to the efficiency in our network and that remains to be crucial",0.1
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
Yes, the question I'm asking, because I want to also get a bit of a view of the CapEx for '21",0.0
"And that's because also the relation with the dividend, of course",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes, that's what I understand",0.0
So partly -- part of the amounts will be phased to 2021 and parts of the amount not,-0.4
Those are -- it's less CapEx,0.0
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
So it will be roughly flattish going into '21, is that then the best balance, just to get a bit of a feel",1.0
"
Pim Berendsen
In total, roughly",0.0
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
Okay",-0.5
"
Herna Verhagen
In total, roughly, yes",0.0
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
Yes",0.0
"And then lastly, the lease payment going up to €80 million, is that related to the new DCs",0.0
And perhaps already preparing for small parcels or is it too early,-1.0
Will this go up then post-2020 because of the SPSS coming live in '21,0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Partly those lease payments relate to depots that we did operate or open in 2019, that were not CapEx",-0.2
"
Marc Zwartsenburg
Yes, correct",0.9
So that is indeed related to that,0.0
"And then going up further, I presume if you open the other one",0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Yes, of course, depending on the split, also on the small parcel sorting center, it's a leasehold, so it's not a building that we will buy, we will rent it",0.0
"And there, the investments are in the sorters and the IT infrastructure and the robots that are required to operate that small parcel sorting center",0.0
"

Marc Zwartsenburg
Okay",-0.5
All right,0.9
That's it,0.0
Thank you very much,1.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Thank you, Marc",1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Thank you",1.0
"
Jochem van de Laarschot
Again switching back to the table here, Andre",0.4
"
Andre Mulder
Andre Mulder, Kepler",0.0
So few questions,-0.1
"First one, in the Q3 presentation, you mentioned that the extra pension costs will be 20 -- €15 million to €25 million",-0.2
"
Pim Berendsen
Yes",0.0
"
Andre Mulder
So it is now €25 million",0.0
Is that driven by the interest rates,0.3
"
Pim Berendsen
Completely and only due to the fact of a deterioration of the interest rates",-1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes",0.0
"
Andre Mulder
Can you -- if you turn things around, can you give a bit of a sensitivity",0.1
"Let's say, if that amount were to be halved, where were you end up with interest rates",-0.3
"
Pim Berendsen
What it -- it is based -- the pension expense for the year 2020 is based at the interest rate for the 31st of December 2019",0.1
So in the year it will not change,-0.1
"And that's pretty big -- I will get back to you on that otherwise, but it was only a few base points that changed basically from Q3 towards the end of the year, and did have -- well, the roughly €10 million impact",0.3
So it's because it -- let's say a few base points on an already very low interest rate has pretty big consequences,-0.7
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes",0.0
"
Andre Mulder
The parcel growth, the volume growth for '18 to '22, 14%",0.3
So I take it for granted that will stay,0.0
You still believe that's possible,0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
That is the CAGR number that we've explained at Capital Markets Day",0.0
The explanation between the 7% to 9% is a predominantly slow down of the overall market,-0.5
"So if there is no change to that market growth, then it will be difficult to get to the 14% CAGR, yes",-1.0
"
Andre Mulder
So if it stay to 7% to 9%, that's possible, if it drops further",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
The market growth is, of course, a little bit higher than the 7% to 9% because of the reason that we see the effect in 2020 of the multivendorship",0.5
That's an effect which we assume will disappear again and then we will move up with market growth,0.4
"So market growth is higher than the 7% to 9%, but slightly higher",0.2
"And that means that if market growth stays at that level, the average of 14% is difficult to reach",-1.0
"
Andre Mulder
Okay",-0.3
"
Pim Berendsen
But what is important, let's say, our aim to get to a better balance in that volume growth and margin development and cash flow conversion will remain the same",0.9
"So we'll look at ways even with potentially slightly lower growth to get the revenue and cost per parcel in the right direction, improving the margin and improving the cash flow conversion from the parcels business going forward",1.0
"
Andre Mulder
Any numbers to mention on Nexive",0.1
How this -- the items in the balance sheet,0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
No",0.0
"
Andre Mulder
The assets held for sale 91, liabilities held for sale 100",0.0
Does these relate to Nexive,0.4
"
Pim Berendsen
No",0.0
"well, not specifically the combination of Postcon and Nexive led to the result of discontinued operations, of which roughly €13 million, €14 million was a fair value adjustment and the balance was the kind of running loss from operating operations in those discontinued operations",-0.8
And we've now valued both businesses on the back of the agreements that we've reached,0.9
"So -- yes, that is [indiscernible] what it is",0.0
"
Andre Mulder
So if you conclude it now, and no further book losses",-0.6
"
Pim Berendsen
No",0.0
"
Andre Mulder
But what’s the amount that you get in with Nexive",-0.1
"
Pim Berendsen
Well, we don't specifically guide towards the individual components of it",0.1
"As we said before, the biggest component of those two transactions is the DTA positions that we have accounted for by being able to use, let's say, the liquidation losses in those countries, because it's asset deals that we've done to get those capitalized in the Dutch situation",-1.0
But the biggest component of the DTA in the balance sheet relates to those two countries,0.0
"

Andre Mulder
Then them on Sandds, those people have joined",0.1
To what extent does that leads to extra costs or possibly lower savings,0.1
"
Herna Verhagen
It doesn't",-0.2
"So what we -- what you, of course, look into is how many people joined, the amount of -- we still have vacancies, which are filled on a normal way",0.0
So we added more capacity out of the market to make sure that we have enough people to deliver the mail,0.0
So it's according to what we expected in our business case and has no negative or positive impact on it,-0.5
"
Andre Mulder
Last question",0.0
What do you aim to do with the Green bond,0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Spend it on green",-0.1
"
Pim Berendsen
Yes",0.0
"The Green Bond was issued on the back of a green framework, basically says that we'll use the proceeds to further optimize or improve our premises",0.6
"So a big component is making even our existing premises more, more green and pre-empt set of certified and also new ones",0.0
Second component will be used to intensify the electrification of our fleet,0.0
Those two are the biggest bucket of that €300 million,0.0
"Third bucket is improving related to robotics using data to further optimize the CO2 emissions, but that's only real and using innovations in that process",0.6
But the two biggest components are related to our depots with solar panels on top of them and fleet,0.0
"
Andre Mulder
And anything you can say about phasing of that",0.1
"
Pim Berendsen
No, not really",-0.1
Other than the fact that we expect to be able to use the €300 million in the 3 to 7-year period with the plans we already have in place to be able to say that we'll spend that €300 million on the green framework topics that we've disclosed,-0.2
"
Unidentified Analyst
[Indiscernible] A few questions",-0.3
"First, on Sandd",0.1
"The existing contracts, could you give some kind of an indication how long that will last on average",0.0
And when do you have the full freedom to price the contracts,0.9
"Will that have a noticeable impact on your numbers, or will that just be modest",0.1
And then two questions about the new metrics,0.0
"Well, obviously, we didn’t knew that the shifts from UCOI to normalize EBIT",-0.1
"Now we get a new one attached to that, is the like-for-like",0.1
I appreciate that you identify a couple of specifics that have -- will have an impact this year,1.0
But what can we expect going forward,0.3
"Will we see two separate rows, or is this just an incident",-1.0
"And then finally, on the dividends payout ratio related to the normalized comprehensive income",0.0
"Obviously, that's not something for today or tomorrow, but did I understand, Pim, correctly that in essence, is this normalized EBIT level apart from net of tax",-1.0
"And if so, wasn't there a more simple way to go for a dividend base than a normalized comprehensive income, which makes it all a bit complicated, I think",-1.0
"
Pim Berendsen
 Okay",-0.2
"
Herna Verhagen
On to Sandd, I think we didn't -- we are not going to disclose around the customer contracts they had",-0.2
"They have, of course, customer contracts we are still running",0.0
"And that means that we, of course, adhere to the contract they have",0.0
What will be the impact on pricing,0.0
It will be moderate,0.0
So don't expect real spikes in price increases,-0.5
"It's moderate pricing policies, which we will continue",0.0
"And that also means that we add moderate pricing when it comes to contracts, which are ended with Sandd",-0.1
"
Unidentified Analyst
And metrics",-0.1
"
Pim Berendsen
The metrics, we go to two metrics, normalized EBIT and free cash flow",0.7
"And particularly this year, we felt it was very important to get you to understand how we move from one to the other, and particularly given the two additional components or the additional pension expense and the effect of the new labor law regulations to be able to indicate that on a like-for-like basis, both parcels and mail business are actually improving",-0.2
"But let's say from a formal point of view, we only have the two metrics, normalized EBIT and free cash flow and that we will report going forward",0.9
"But to understand what happens and the underlying business, we felt it appropriate to make clear what the like-for-like number would be",0.2
"Then on the dividend policy, what we try to do is, is relate to a easy to be recognized number because we do report the total comprehensive income in each press release and in each annual report",0.9
"And the reason why not to go to net profit is: one is, given the specific pension situation in PostNL, it would be strange not to include the other comprehensive income in the base on which you define dividends, because there you have the actual gains on the difference between pension expense and pension cash out",-0.9
So not including that would basically lead to a too low a base for dividend distribution calculation,-0.4
That is one component,0.0
Then subsequently we feel that you need to exclude the results from discontinued ops,0.0
"Well, as of 2020 there won't be any, but in any event, from a structure on a logical point of view, that is an element to look at",0.0
And then the only thing that happens to the total comprehensive income is normalizations that are the same as the normalizations on EBIT,-0.1
So just look at the total comprehensive income for the period line,0.0
"Look at the total normalization, let's say for the sake of argument that they are 10, then you take the net of tax effects",-0.7
So €7,-0.1
"5 million that you adjust on the comprehensive income to get to normalized comprehensive income, which will then be the base on which you apply the 70% to 90% payout ratio",0.0
"

Unidentified Analyst
Okay",-0.7
"
Jochem van de Laarschot
Operator, please link us to Ruben Devos of KBC, if he is there",0.1
"
Herna Verhagen
Very quiet",0.1
"
Ruben Devos
Just to come on the, yes, the divestments of PCS, Spotta, and Nexive",0.0
"Yes, I understand you don’t provide guidance on individual sales, but I was curious whether you could give a rough indication of the combined cash in for the disposals, to get a bit of an idea, we should see the changes in the balance sheet, aside from the free cash flow guidance you've given",-1.0
That's the first question,0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
I said we will not make that split between Nexive, Postcon and the others",-0.1
"As I said, in relation to the [indiscernible] in the countries, the cash will predominantly be as a consequence of the DTA that we have included in the balance sheet",0.0
"If you look at the annual report, you will see that there is a earn out arrangement or Postcon that can lead to a cash in or something between 0 and 12 million",0.0
What we have taken a view on,0.0
"And as you know, we will be involved in Nexive going forward at a 20% minority shareholder, which potentially gives us an upside on the back of the valuation that we just discussed",-0.1
"The PCS, the PostNL Communication Services business, did lead to an individual cash in and Spotta was a sale also in relation to the fundamental changes in the market that we've seen there",0.0
"So, then I gave you a little bit of guidance on how you should look at it, but not more specifics, I'm afraid",-1.0
"
Ruben Devos
Okay",-0.1
"So quite some scope changes, let's say in the last 12 months",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes",0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Yes [indiscernible] forced to really get us to focus on the meal business from capitalizing on the Sandd acquisition synergy effect and to focus on the parcel e-commerce business going forward",-0.9
"
Ruben Devos
Okay",-0.1
"So going forward, you continue to see opportunities in terms of divestments to increasingly focus on your core activities or are you down for now",-0.1
"
Herna Verhagen
No",0.0
"I think when you look to 2020 and forward, we of course, we'll keep looking into our portfolio and find out if they're adding to our core business in mail and parcels",0.0
"And if not, then we start up a discussion of the divestment",0.0
"So that's what we anyway will do, because our core business is in mail and parcels, the networks of mail and parcels and every adjacent market, which is adding to those mail and parcel networks",0.0
"
Ruben Devos
Okay",-0.1
And then just another one on the customer satisfaction,0.0
"The presentation says it's improving, which is interesting, obviously, if you take into account the competition in the parcel delivery market",0.8
"I was curious, could you sort of support that with numbers like a net promoter score, any kind or how PostNL compares to competition on this end",1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
What we use is very satisfies -- satisfy the customers, which is not and exactly the same as an NPS score",0.9
So it's difficult to compare it to NPS scores of others,-1.0
"We see an increase in the amount of very satisfied customers compared to the first half of 2019, which is partly positively influenced by the quality of our delivery",1.0
It's positively influenced by the amount of the possibility people feel to get their parcel when and whenever they want to have it,0.1
So those are very important elements when it comes to customer satisfaction,0.1
"
Ruben Devos
Okay",-0.1
"And then just lastly on Spring, also there an improving performance",0.6
A bit of a reversal versus the reported trends in the last two years,-0.2
"Yes, some additional color on what happened in Q4 and why that improved would be helpful",1.0
Thank you,1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
I think the business improved within Spring partly, of course, we saw positive impact in volume, partly because of all the actions we've put into place within spring to get the organization right and to get the organization aligned to the volumes we received",1.0
So some of the effect of all those things we communicated in earlier quarters on changes in Spring did come into effect in Q4,-0.1
And that's the reason why you did see a slight increase or improvement in revenue,0.8
"

Ruben Devos
Okay",-0.1
Thank you,1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Thank you",1.0
"
Jochem van de Laarschot
As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, ""*"", ""1"" helps to get in line",0.9
"We've got one more, I think, operator",0.1
"
Operator
Yes, sir",0.0
It's correct,1.0
"That’s David Kerstens, Jefferies",0.0
Go ahead,0.2
"
David Kerstens
Hi",0.0
"Good morning, everybody",1.0
"I've got two questions, please",0.0
"First of all, regarding the increasing rate of E substitution that you're guiding for, what's driving that",0.1
I think you highlighted previously that you had about 2 to 3 percentage points of market share loss,-0.3
"Now you have taken over Sandd, but you were still at minus 10% in Q4 and you're going for 8% to 10% for next year",0.0
I appreciate there is a 1 point -- 1 percentage point election effect from the European elections last May,0.4
But it would still imply that your rate of substitution deteriorates by about 2 percentage points,-1.0
Are there any specific customer groups that are advising that,0.0
What are you seeing in the market,0.0
And the second question,0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Let's do the calculation again first",0.1
"So we did see 8% to 10% decrease in 2019, which is 9",0.0
7% of substitution or decrease without Sandd,0.0
That's one,0.0
The impact we said that competition did have is a 1% to 2% -- around 2%,0.0
What you do see is two effect in 2020,0.0
"You do see, of course, the effect of around 1% because of election",0.0
And that's what you have to deduct if you want to have it like-for-like,0.3
"And secondly, I think there is still some competition in the Dutch market",0.0
So we do not see that much changes from what we did say before,-0.8
"We expect it to be somewhere between 8% to 10% taking into account, as already said, for example, the elections, which do have quite -- which are quite impactful when it comes to volume decline",-0.1
"
David Kerstens
So stable rate of underlying new substitution, you think",1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes",0.0
"
Pim Berendsen
Yes",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
That's what we think",0.1
"
David Kerstens
And then, the second question regarding the parcel volume growth of 7% to 9%, you said that based on experience in the other postal markets, you see a positive impact from Amazon coming in, developing the e-commerce category further",0.9
"Have you included anything in your volume guidance for this effect, or do you also see potentially Amazon moving to a dual suppliership",0.0
And offsetting that positive effect,0.4
"
Herna Verhagen
As I said, in the 7% to 9% are taken into account the effect we do expect in 2020",0.0
"And Amazon already, of course, acts with a dual vendorship approach at this moment in time",0.0
"
David Kerstens
Right",0.9
"Okay, that's great",1.0
Thank you very much,1.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Thank you",1.0
"
Jochem van de Laarschot
I think this concludes the call",0.2
We've got one [indiscernible] in the room only,0.0
Please go ahead,0.1
"
Pim Berendsen
Hello, [indiscernible]",0.0
"
Unidentified Analyst
Sometime ago, you made a call for hard subsidies out of fear that higher prices could cause volumes to spiral down",-1.0
Has there been any reaction from politics on that,-0.1
"
Herna Verhagen
Not yet",0.1
"
Pim Berendsen
No",0.0

Herna Verhagen
I didn't know",-0.2

But when do you expect -- are you in talks with politicians or not",-0.7

Herna Verhagen
Yes",0.0

Pim Berendsen
If they want to maintain the system, that's possibly the only way forward",0.0
"
Herna Verhagen
Yes, I think, I'm not sure, of course, what is picked up by politicians and what is not",0.0
"So the only thing what I do know is that keeping it on the agenda is important and then hopefully at a certain point in time, you get some traction",0.0
"
Jochem van de Laarschot
Okay",-0.3

Thanks, Latif",1.0
Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit’s second quarter fiscal 2020 conference call,1.0
"I am here with Intuit’s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO",0.0
"We are also joined by Ken Lin, Founder and CEO of Credit Karma",0.0
"
Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements",0.9
There are number of factors that could cause Intuit’s results to differ materially from our expectations,0.0
"You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings",-0.8

And with that, I will turn it call over to Sasan",0.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Great",1.0
"Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us",1.0
We posted strong results for the first half of fiscal year 2020,0.0
"I am also excited to announce that we have reached an agreement to acquire Credit Karma, a pioneer in the financial technology sector, for approximately $7",0.5
1 billion,0.0
I could not be more enthusiastic about this transformational transaction and I am thrilled to welcome the talented Credit Karma team,1.0
"Ken Lin, the Founder and CEO of Credit Karma is with us today to talk about our shared excitement and commitment to one simple goal, empowering consumers to make smart decisions about their money",0.6
We posted a slide deck on our website containing an overview of the agreement which provides more details,0.0
"
Let me start with a quick recap of the quarter",0.0
We are halfway through fiscal year 2020 and continue to see strong momentum across the company as we make progress on our strategy to become an AI-driven expert platform,0.2
Second quarter revenue grew 13% overall fueled by 17% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and 8% growth in the Consumer Group,0.4
Revenue for the Strategic Partner Group grew 8%,0.1
"With this strong performance, we remain on track to deliver our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance",0.1
"

Let me remind you of the customer problems that we are addressing",-1.0
All of our customers are consumers and have a common set of needs,0.0
"They are all trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and payoff debt and those who have made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves have an additional set of needs",-0.7
"They want to find and keep customers, get paid, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right",0.8
"To solve our customers’ most pressing problems, we remain focused on becoming an AI-driven expert platform",-0.9
We are working to achieve this strategy by pursuing five big bets,0.2
"These include revolutionize speed to benefit, so our customers fall in love with the product instantly; connect people to experts to improve confidence; unlock smart money decisions to put more money back in our customers’ pockets; become the center of small business growth by fueling our customers’ growth; and disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced",0.3
"
Throughout the call, I will update you on where we stand on these bets",0.0
"With that context, let me start with tax",0.0
We are confident in our strategy and are on track to deliver and achieve our full year guidance,1.0
"As a reminder, there are four key drivers of our consumer tax business",0.0
The first is total number of returns that is filed with the IRS,-0.1
The second is the percentage of those returns filed using DIY software,0.0
The third is our share within the DIY software category,0.0
And the fourth is the average revenue per return,-0.1
Based on the latest IRS data and the DIY software category is performing better than assisted as it has for more than a decade,1.0
"As the category leader, we view it as our responsibility to help drive category awareness and growth",0.8
So we are pleased with this result,1.0
"
Through February 7, IRS data shows total e-filed returns are up 0",0.0
"6%, with self-prepared e-files up 3",0.0
5% and assisted e-files down 3,0.0
7%,0.0
"Based on what we are seeing, our share within the DIY category is up year-over-year",0.0
"We are growing the category and growing our share, which is right where we want to be",1.0
"Our strategy for the Consumer Group is to expand our lead in the DIY category, transform the assisted tax preparation category and disrupt consumer finance",-0.7
This is all in service of helping our customers make ends meet and get the largest tax refund,0.9
"
Let me share a few examples of how we are delivering for our customers this season",0.8
"Within the DIY category, which is $3 billion in TAM, we are delivering enhancements to our premier offering to better serve customers with investments",0.8
"We are driving faster growth in under-penetrated segments, including Latinx and Self-Employed",0.9
We are also expanding free eligibility to include all enlisted active duty military and reservists and providing historical tax return access for all customers,0.8
"
In the assisted category, which is $20 billion in TAM, we continue to make progress with our second big bet to connect people to experts with TurboTax Live",0.1
We are working to further increase customer confidence on our platform by enhancing first time use,0.9
"This season, we improved accessibility back to experts by offering customers the option to connect with an expert when they first sign-in to TurboTax Live to address top of mind questions",0.8
We also introduced real-time chat and a floating Live Help button to make it easier to connect with live help at all stages of the return process,0.7
"We continue to accelerate the application of AI to create tools for experts to automate repetitive tasks, increase efficiency and drive an even better customer experience",-0.5
"
Beyond tax, we continue to make progress disrupting consumer finance, which represents $29 billion in TAM",-0.9
This aligns with our third big bet to unlock smart money decisions,0.7
"Through our Turbo offering, we are addressing key customer problems like managing debt, saving money and improving financial health overall",0.4
We are building on last season’s success by expanding the financial marketplace,0.9
We are now live with pre-qualification partners offering both credit cards and personal loans to help customers save money and to provide partners with more qualified leads,0.1
"Nearly 25% of our weekly active users have set a credit score, savings or debt-related goal in Turbo and we expect this to drive higher engagement over time",-0.9
Acquiring Credit Karma expands our TAM from $29 billion to $57 billion accelerating our time to market moving beyond tax while also developing new ways to monetize our offerings,0.1
"

Now, turning to small business, we delivered another strong quarter in our Small Business and Self-Employed Group with Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%, exceeding our target to grow more than 30%",0.4
We continue to solve key customer pain points as we execute on our big bets,-1.0
"We remain encouraged with our early results with QuickBooks Live, part of our second big bet to connect people to experts, opening access to a $10 billion bookkeeping opportunity",0.2
"QuickBooks Live solves one of the customers’ biggest needs confidence and peace of mind, while helping experts grow their business and find new customers",0.3
"We are now also offering setup help, providing customers with confidence from the moment they subscribe",0.9
"
We are working to achieve our vision of being the center of small business growth, our fourth big bet, by helping our customers get paid faster, manage capital and pay employees with confidence",0.8
We introduced a new payroll lineup featuring full service across all offerings as well as TSheets integration for time tracking that’s resulting in customers adopting TSheets at 3x the rate they did prior to launching the integrated offering and a tax penalty free guaranteed for select offerings,0.5
"We also introduced a feature that double checks customers’ over time calculations, reducing the likelihood of fines and penalties",-0.8
"
We continue to make progress on our fifth big bet, disrupting the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees",-0.3
We developed this offering to help us increase retention of larger customers and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by higher-priced competitive offerings,0.3
"Approximately 75% of our current QBO Advanced customers have traded up from our existing QBO product, unlocking benefits such as faster invoicing with batch import tools, automation, more customized fields and user permissions",0.2
"
Now, I want to address the news we announced today to acquire Credit Karma",0.1
I have long been an admirer of the company that Ken and his team have built,0.8
"As we have gotten to know each other, Ken and I realized we both share one simple goal, empowering consumers to make smart decisions about their money",1.0
This combination fits directly with Intuit’s mission and long-term strategy,0.0
Our mission is to power prosperity around the world,0.9
And our bold goal for 2025 is to double the household savings rate for customers on our platform,0.1
This acquisition is a giant step forward in achieving that goal and significantly accelerates execution of our big bet to unlock smart money decisions,0.6
"This big bet is aimed at helping consumers address the personal finance problems they face today helping them reduce debt, maximize savings and put more money in their pockets",-0.4
"
Today, many consumers struggle with not knowing or fully understanding where they stand with their finances and they struggle to make ends meet",-1.0
Household debt in the United States hit $14,-0.7
1 trillion,0.1
23 million consumers relied on at least one payday loan in 2018 to get faster access to cash,0.3
"If consumers just had the tools to better understand their financial health and opportunities to improve it, they could unlock billions of dollars of potential savings",0.9
"For example, understanding the difference and availability of lower cost personal loans versus high cost credit cards could save consumers $20 billion to 40 billion",0.4
And Credit Karma estimates that 80% of Americans overpay on car loans to the tune of $37 billion as there is no easy way to compare offerings,-1.0
"Consumers want to do better and 60% say they are trying to improve their credit score, but they need help",1.0
We aspire to do more and Credit Karma is the perfect partner to help us do this,1.0
"

Credit Karma shares our goal of making it simple for consumers to make better decisions with their money through a platform that works like a personalized financial assistant, helping consumers find the right financial products, putting more money in their pockets and providing them with insights and advice",0.1
"This platform will provide consumers with transparent access to their critical personal financial information, including their income, spending and credit history to help them better understand their complete financial picture and use it to their advantage, such as obtaining better interest rates",0.5
The result will be a complete financial profile that puts the power in consumers’ hands so they can take the steps necessary to improve their financial health,0.8
"
Let me tell you what this will look like",0.0
"To find the right financial products, we will match consumers with pre-approved offers on personal loans, home loans, credit cards and insurance",0.0
We will put more money in their pockets by connecting them to higher yield savings accounts and faster access to their hard earned paycheck,-0.7
We will also provide insights and connect them to experts to help consumers make better decisions about their money and improve their credit score,0.9
All of this will be done by leveraging artificial intelligence and connecting consumers to over 100 financial partners on the platform solving a two-sided problem,-1.0
This consumer finance platform offers compelling value for our financial institution partners as we provide efficient access to a broad set of qualified customers,0.3
"
While consumers strive to be more informed about their finances and want personalized offers from a trusted source, financial institutions want high-quality leads and face real challenges matching their products to the right customers",0.5
We can help them target their offers based on metrics like verified income and credit history giving them the ability to reach qualified prospects,0.7
"Ken will get into this shortly, but Credit Karma’s history is remarkable",0.9
"The Credit Karma platform has attracted more than 100 million members, with 88% engagement via mobile among active users and over one-third of which are active on the platform each month",0.0
The platform has a net promoter score of 69,0.0
"The company recorded revenue of approximately $1 billion in calendar year 2019, growing 20% year-over-year",0.0
"Impressively, over 90% of Credit Karma’s annual revenue results from existing members returning to the platform",0.4
"Together, we can deliver unprecedented benefits to customers, combining the benefits of scale, trust and data",1.0
"
Let me turn it over to Ken, Credit Karma’s founder and CEO, to share his perspective on the transaction",0.1
"
Ken Lin
Thanks, Sasan",1.0
I’m incredibly excited about today’s announcement,1.0
As Sasan mentioned through many conversations we have found a real shared goal for changing personal finance for the better of consumers,1.0
"When we started the company in 2007, we had a fundamental belief that consumers are being left behind in financial services innovation",0.0
We started the company with a mission to Champion Financial Progress for All with the intention of leveling the playing field for all consumers,0.6
"In 2008, we launched the Credit Karma platform by providing consumers completely free credit scores",0.7
"Now, 12 years later we have provided more than four billion credit scores and created a platform with over 100 million members, over a third of which are active on the site every month",0.0
"Notably, we are helping a new generation better manage their finances, as more than half of our members are under the age of 44",0.9
"We use the term members because our users are unique, have verified information from a third party and begin an engagement loop with our products",0.1
"

When we started the business we saw consumers lost in a sea of complexity and the opportunity for technology to make a difference",-1.0
"Today, we are leaders and our business model is quite simple: we help consumers find the right product for them based on their credit and financial profile with their consent",0.6
"Intuit enables us to strengthen this ability by allowing customers to add income data to that profile, enable members to see more offers through which they qualify",0.1
"Then, we simplify the application process, we help members significantly increase their probability of approval, and we help members transparently compare rates and features",0.7
"We do this for credit cards, personal loans, auto lending, mortgages, high yield savings accounts, auto insurance, home insurance and other verticals to come",0.0
"So this opportunity is also meaningful and exciting for all our trusted partners, to believe that and support us throughout our history",1.0
"These personalized recommendations are embedded by technology, and 8 billion daily model predictions",0.0
Perhaps what I am most excited about is the real impact we’ve had on consumers' lives,0.7
"As one example, we have seen meaningful increases in credit scores from members who regularly engage on our platform overtime",0.5
There are many reasons why it makes sense to join forces with Intuit right now,0.4
"First and foremost, we have the ability to collaborate and bring technology solutions to solve real consumer problems",-0.9
"We see a platform which provides consumers with transparent access to their critical personal financial information - including their income, spending and credit history - to help them better understand their complete financial picture and use it to their advantage, such as obtaining a better interest rate",0.4
Our insights will significantly accelerate Credit Karma’s mission and we will then make a larger impact on our customers more quickly than either of us are able to alone,-0.9
"With millions of customers, more financial partners, and more resourcing, I am convinced we will be able to build a more valuable business that enables us to achieve our combined goals",1.0
I also have to say that the culture and team Sasan has put in place are critical factors in our decision to join together,-0.8
We got inspired by Intuit’s mission to power prosperity around the world and our team is ready to join Intuit on that journey,0.6
"To each of my 1,300 Credit Karma colleagues, Karmanauts, thank you",1.0
I am deeply proud of the company we have built and the culture we have created,1.0
"We worked long and hard to get to a day like this, yet as I have always said -- this is one step in our journey together",-0.5
Our mission to champion our members’ financial progress remains the same,0.6
"Now, with our partner with Intuit, we will have the resources and capabilities to achieve our goals in a remarkable, significant and impactful way",0.9
"I’ll pass it back to you, Sasan",0.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Awesome",1.0
"Thanks, Ken",1.0
"I’d like to add that while we see a lot of innovation and investment, in the marketplace we don’t see anyone with our collective capabilities pursuing a personalized financial assistant",0.7
This is why we believe this combination can transform FinTech and power the economy,0.0
We have the ability to bring together consumers and financial institutions in innovative ways that lowers costs for all those involved and levels the playing field for consumers of all economic status,0.2
"After the transaction closes, Ken will report to me, and continue to lead the Credit Karma team from its headquarters in San Francisco",0.0
Credit Karma will continue to operate under its current brand,0.2
Michelle will share the financial details of the transaction in a few minutes,0.0
"
To wrap up, we are pleased with the continued momentum of our Small Business and Self-Employed Group",1.0
We remain laser focused delivering for our customers during tax season and I could not be more excited about the Credit Karma acquisition and the opportunity it provides us to power prosperity for our customers,0.9
"

Now, let me hand it over to Michelle",0.1
"
Michelle Clatterbuck
Thanks, Sasan",1.0
"Good afternoon, everyone",1.0
"I will start by providing an overview of financial results in the quarter, and then share more details on the proposed acquisition of Credit Karma we announced today",0.1
"For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1",0.0
"7 billion, up 13% year-over-year, GAAP operating income of $270 million, a 16% increase, non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, a 13% increase, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0",0.0
"91, versus $0",0.0
"72 a year ago, a 26% increase and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1",0.0
"16, up from $1",0.0
"00 last year, a 16% increase",0.0
"
Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $499 million, up 8% for the second quarter",-0.1
"As we enter our third year of TurboTax Live, our technology-first approach continues to give us confidence we can expand our live offerings and maintain attractive Intuit operating margin longer term",0.5
"As Sasan shared earlier, we are now using AI to automate repetitive tasks for experts on our platform, which we expect to increase efficiency and drive an even better customer experience",0.9
"Based on data published by the IRS, the broader tax season got off to a slow start through January, when total e-filed returns were down 0",-1.0
7%,0.0
We remain confident in our plans and guidance for the year,1.0
"And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenue grew 8% in the second quarter, reflecting delivery of more forms during the second quarter as compared to the same period last year",-0.2
"
In Small Business and Self-Employed, revenue grew 17% during the second quarter, fueled by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%",0.2
"Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally",0.0
"Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 43% in fiscal Q2 driven mainly by strong customer growth and to a lesser extent higher effective prices and mix-shift",0.2
"Second, we continue to make progress connecting the ecosystem; Online Services revenue, which includes payroll, payments, time tracking and capital, grew 23% in fiscal Q2",0.0
"Within QuickBooks Online payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds from a mix shift to our full service offering",0.9
"Within QuickBooks Online payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer",0.2
"Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q2",0.6
Total international online revenue again grew over 60%,-0.6
"We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%",1.0
"Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 1% in the second quarter, inline with our expectations, as QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter",0.1
"
Let me now spend a minute on the Credit Karma acquisition that Sasan and Ken described earlier",-0.2
Intuit has agreed to pay total consideration of approximately $7,0.0
"1 billion to acquire Credit Karma, comprised of half cash and half stock",-0.1
The total consideration is subject to customary adjustments and includes an estimated $1 billion of equity awards that will be expensed over a period of up to three years,-0.1
We will also deliver approximately $300 million of retention equity through restricted stock awarded to Credit Karma employees that will be expensed over four years,0.0
We plan to finance the cash portion of the transaction through cash and our existing unsecured line of credit,-0.1
"We expect the transaction to close in the second half of calendar year 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions",0.0
We do not foresee an impact to maintaining our dividend and share repurchase principles due to the Credit Karma transaction,0.0
We expect the transaction to be neutral to accretive to Intuit’s non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes,0.0
We will provide updated Intuit guidance once the transaction is closed,0.0
"

Now, turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue",0.4
Our financial principles in total have not changed and remain a durable framework for us,0.1
We finished the quarter with $2,0.0
3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet,0.1
We repurchased $139 million of stock in the second quarter,0.0
We have approximately $2,0.0
4 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market each quarter,0.0
The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0,0.0
"53 per share, payable April 20th, 2020",0.0
This represents a 13% increase versus last year,0.0
"
Turning to guidance, our Q3 fiscal 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $5",0.0
53 to $5,0.0
"58, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $5",0.0
90 to $5,0.0
95,0.0
We expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% for fiscal 2020,-0.2
You can find our Q3 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet,0.0
"
And with that, I will turn it back over to Sasan",0.0

Sasan Goodarzi
Great",1.0
"Thank you, Michelle",1.0
"I would like to thank our employees, our customers and partners for another strong quarter",1.0
I am excited about joining forces with Credit Karma and the transformative experience we can offer customers together,0.9
We will share more about our progress in the coming months,0.9
"Now, let’s open it up for questions to hear what’s on your mind",-0.1
"
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you",1.0
"[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse",0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Brad Zelnick
Excellent",1.0
Thank you so much and thanks for taking the question,1.0
"Congrats on the deal today, certainly, a company that we have been an admirer for a long time as well",1.0
"But Sasan, if I can ask, Intuit’s history includes some of the best acquisitions of all time in software and some deals that maybe were a bit less than great and with Credit Karma now the largest in the company’s history, I only have two questions, why is this the right time for Credit Karma and the push into consumer finance just given the heightened awareness on data privacy and where we are in the consumer credit cycle and two, what’s the approach with this asset that will be different this time",1.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Great",1.0
"Hey, Brad",0.1
Thank you for your question,1.0
We are equally admirers of Credit Karma,0.4
"A couple of things, I would say",0.0
Let me start with your question as to why now,0.0
This is very core to what we have declared around helping our customers make ends meet,1.0
"It’s very core to the strategy that we’ve declared, which is about an AI driven expert platform and what we declared is that because everyone that we serve are consumers, we are very focused on unlocking smart money decisions and together with Credit Karma there are things that we can do to benefit consumers that we believe are significant",0.6
"First and foremost, consumers are in significant debt",-0.9
"They over pay on fees whether it’s credit cards, whether it’s home loans, auto loans whether it’s insurance",-1.0
"They don’t have access to advice in terms what are the things that they need to do to improve their credit score and their credit rating which matters a lot, so when it comes to the interest that they pay and also just the other side of it, which is how do they save money and how do they ultimately grow that money and in order to really be able to deliver against that, what we bring together with Credit Karma is scale and capability, it’s scale of customers and scale of customers’ data and it’s the capability that we have and so ultimately now, customers are going to be able to leverage their own data, their income data, their spending data, their credit history, their life situations",0.8
"I mean, together with Credit Karma, the customers will have access to all their information in one place and then we’ll be able to match them with financial products that are right for them",0.9
We’ll be able to connect them to savings accounts,0.0
We’ll be able to help them get early access to their pay check and we will be able to provide insights and advice so they can actually continue to improve their financial habit,1.0
So in terms of why is this the right time,0.5
"It’s absolutely core to what we’ve declared, its core to the goals that we’ve set, and we believe that together we can truly do things that benefit consumers and benefit financial institutions because we will provide them also more choice",1.0
So that’s why it’s the right time,0.4
"I think in terms of acquisitions, I would just say that the last several that we’ve made have been extremely successful and we’ve actually held them up as role models internally and we’ve recently talked to our board about it",-0.3
"TSheets [indiscernible] just two of the latest three and the reason is we’ve studied our history and we’ve learned what works and what doesn’t work and the clarity that we have around three things that matter, one is the mission and purpose – the alignment that we have with Ken and the team; two, the absolute alignments that we have on priorities; and third, and I would say equally as important is Ken is in charge",0.5
Our goal is to fuel his success and Credit Karma’s success and just how we’ve organized around the work is essential to the success,1.0
"So across the board, we have a lot of confidence and are very clear about how to manage the risks",0.6
"

Brad Zelnick
Sasan thank you so much for the very thoughtful answer",1.0
"If I could just sneak in one for Ken, Ken, can you talk about the concept of autonomous finance and why being on Intuit’s platform can help to accelerate that vision",0.9
Thank you,1.0
"
Ken Lin
Yes, absolutely",0.0
So thanks for the question,1.0
"So autonomous finance right is really our ability to help consumers automate their financial life in a way that reduces friction, increases uncertainty, and creates more transparency and efficiency",0.3
"So if you look at the problems that exist today, most consumers don’t know which are the right products for them, they don’t know how to apply for those products and there’s so much friction to making it happen",-1.0
"So for us, our platform is really predicated on integrating with financial institutions so that you can make it easy, moving the dollars or automating the process itself, so it does not require as much work and therefore friction and then lastly, adding a layer of education to consumers to understand what is absolutely best for them and if you do that, we fundamentally believe we can level the playing field for the most disadvantaged and most vulnerable consumers and assist them",0.8
"
Brad Zelnick
Thanks so much",1.0
Congrats,0.9

Ken Lin
Thank you",1.0

Operator
Thank you",1.0
Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Keith Weiss
Excellent",1.0
Thank you guys and thank you for taking the question,1.0
A question on the sort of the overlap within the product lines between Credit Karma and in the TurboTax line,0.0
How should we think about that on a going forward basis,0.0
Credit Karma does tax and has a pre-tax offering obviously TurboTax does a lot of tax,-0.8
I always thought of Turbo as a competing solution to sort of the core Credit Karma solution in terms of giving people more visibility into their financial health and giving offers,0.9
So Credit Karma is going to be a stand-alone,-1.0
"It’s going to exist as a separate brand, is it going to be competing offerings under the same umbrella of Intuit or how should we think about that product overlap on a go-forward basis",-0.1
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Got it",0.4
Great,1.0
"Thank you, Keith for the question",1.0
"Let me just start with tax, our intent is to keep the free tax software within Credit Karma because we believe in what they are doing and the fact that customers should have choice and we are not doing this deal because of tax",0.8
They have 106 million customers and really we are doing this because we believe that we can truly create a consumer finance platform that can serve as a financial assistant to really power the prosperity of customers,0.9
So that is really the strategic rationale and reason for the deal and we will continue to offer taxes for free through Credit Karma and through TurboTax and we’re very confident in that go-forward approach,1.0
"In terms of Mint and Turbo, I think I would go back to what I shared a moment ago with Brad",0.0
"We are very focused on helping customers make ends meet and we are very focused on unlocking smart money decisions for our customers and ultimately, this is really about speed the market",1.0
"This is really about bringing the capabilities of the two companies together, the scale of the customers’ data and capabilities to be able to move much faster to help these customers that are really underserved, struggling and are looking for help and that’s really the rationale for why we are doing this and specifically around Mint and Turbo, our game plan over time is actually to combine that into one app and we want to focus entirely on Credit Karma’s growth and we don’t actually want to distract Credit Karma at all with the fact that there is Turbo and there is Credit Karma",0.9
The reality is customers have choice and they’ll be able to pick the product that’s right for them,0.2
"Sorry, go ahead",-1.0
"

Keith Weiss
So just to be clear, will the Mint and Turbo apps, will those consolidate into one app with Credit Karma or is there going to be a separate Mint Turbo app and a separate Credit Karma app",0.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
No, no, they will be – ultimately, they will be separate",0.0
"They will not be combined into one app only because I think our focus is we have a huge opportunity to ensure that we can fuel Credit Karma’s growth and we don’t want to have any distractions other than ensuring that they can deliver for customers, so they will be separate apps",0.9
"
Keith Weiss
Okay, that’s clear",0.1
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Yes and Keith, just a note on Credit Karma, I think from our perspective, we’re neither a credit score company nor are we a tax company",-0.1
We focus on solving consumer problems,-1.0
"So for us, our members who are coming to us asking for credit scores are really asking for how can they borrow at the best rates possible and on the opposite side of that when consumers are coming to us from our tax product, it’s really about getting their dollars back from the government and sort of doing the necessities",1.0
"So we think of that not as a product per se, but really the problems or the challenges that we’re solving on behalf of our members",-1.0
"
Keith Weiss
Got it",0.5
And if I could throw in one follow-up for Michelle,0.0
"To get to a neutral to accretive situation with Credit Karma, is there any synergies you are assuming on that either on the revenue side or the expense side of the equation or is it just the profitability of Credit Karma today can get you there on an accretion basis",-0.1
"
Michelle Clatterbuck
When we look at Credit Karma, they really bring a big track record of success with the beyond user paid business models",0.9
"They have revenue of approximately $1 billion in calendar year 2019, which was growing at 20%",0.0
"They’ve reached scale with high engagement, robust marketplace",0.9
"We are really not able to share any of the profitability information at this point in time, but we do feel good about their platform model and the company’s commitment to really serving and engaging their members",1.0
"And then as we stated, we do believe that we will be in a neutral to accretive our position in our non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes",0.0
"
Keith Weiss
Got it",0.5
"Alright, thank you",1.0

Sasan Goodarzi

Robert Simmons
Hi, this is Robert Simmons on for Alex",0.1
Thanks for taking the questions,1.0
"Can you talk about the results so far in season for Live, surely it won’t triple again this year, but how is it tracking",-0.5
"
Sasan Goodarzi
We are actually very pleased with the progress and the results that we’re making",1.0
"I mean, first, I would start by saying, as the category leaders, our focus is to grow the category, which we feel like we’ve had a large part in doing so given what the stats I shared earlier that the do-it-yourself category is growing faster than assisted and we have been able to increase our share and a driver of us being able to increase our share is the continued traction and growth with TurboTax Live and we are very pleased with the results that we’re seeing and it’s in line with what we would expect through this early part of the season and I think I would just remind that we are so early in our journey of going after this $20 billion market of transforming the assisted marketplace that we expect continued accelerated growth from TurboTax Live given that it is a seamless platform for customers to use at the ease of their home or office and they can get access to expertise at anytime they wish throughout the experience",0.1
So we are just at the beginning of the journey of what’s possible with TurboTax Live,0.2
"

Robert Simmons
Got it",0.3
"Great, thanks",1.0
"And then, have you noticed any competitive change from others doing similar things such as H&amp;R Block",0.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
I can’t comment on H&amp;R Block other than I really love what we’re seeing in our results, we are growing the category, we’re taking share and we are seeing the growth that we would have expected in TurboTax Live and continuing to benefit from our focus around the first time use, more access points for experts, and making the expert platform easier that gives us the opportunity to ensure efficiency and expanding margins over time",1.0
"So we – and by the way, we also have experienced that more folks that enter the category, the more we’re actually able to accelerate the growth in the category",0.9
"So far, what we are seeing is exactly what we would have expected",-1.0

"I just wanted to add another question on that and that was the first question, but I think some of the questions that we’re getting, is this a signal at all of maybe anything in your core business slowing, is there any slowdown or does this really just open up an adjacent market with a lot of new opportunities for you",-0.6
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Yes, this is about acceleration",0.0
"The way you should think about this is we get to expand our TAM, we are acquiring a business that has incredible capabilities of $1 billion growing 20% plus with a platform model that has the ability to grow operating margins over time and frankly, more importantly, all of that is possible because we are able to do things for consumers and provide them more choice and more benefits and do the same for financial institutions",0.9
"I would look at this as, it’s squarely focused on one of our five best that we declared and it’s all about acceleration while we continue to see acceleration really connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live, and some of what we’re doing on the small business front",1.0
So this is about acceleration,0.0

Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities,0.0
Your question please,0.0
"
Ken Wong
Great, thanks for taking my question",1.0
"Maybe first back to the Credit Karma’s transaction, I think we all understand what great brands both TurboTax and Credit Karma and we see maybe the long-term synergies on the consumer side",1.0
Just wondering is there any benefit to or from your small business division that we might be missing in terms of how it might interplay with this transaction here,0.7
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Let me start and I’ll have Ken add",0.4
"One of the things that we’ve been very intentional and working with Ken and the team on is alignment on purpose and vision, alignment on priorities, and ensuring that Ken is in charge and has what he needs to be able to deliver for customers and accelerate Credit Karma’s growth and so we believe that there is an opportunity serving small businesses, but ultimately over time, Ken will decide when is that right time because ultimately we want to – there is so much opportunity ahead of us, but let me let Ken jump into that because I know he’s been thinking about small businesses for some time",0.4
"
Ken Lin
Thanks, well, if you think about what Credit Karma does from a business model perspective, it’s again providing consumers with the certainty of finding the right products at a great rate and some of the best rates in the market",1.0
"That same problem exists for small business users and historically for Credit Karma is how it’s been challenging to determine who are small business owners, I think that’s an opportunity for us to work together in the sense that we are now able to solve that problem for not just consumers, but small business owners as well",-1.0
So we think that’s a big upside in the future,0.0
"

Ken Wong
Got it",0.1
Great,1.0
"And then maybe a follow-up just on, you did go through some of the tax dynamics this year, but on that fourth driver, ARPU, you guys didn’t really run into that too much",-0.8
Just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of what you might be seeing on the ARPU side especially it seems like your early marketing has less of a focus on free versus last year,1.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Well, as you know, when we talked about our long-term expectations and in essence shared that it’s between 8% to 12%, one of the larger drivers of that was ARPU simply from the standpoint that we are focused on transforming assisted with our platform and there is just an opportunity to increase our ARPU",0.6
"We’ll share after season how that’s performing, but I would tell you everything that we see so far in early season – there’s results that you see because there is three days to four days of IRS opening, which is very a small portion of the results and there is what we see you through year-to-date and season to date and it’s really in line with what we had assumed and again, we like what we see",-0.4

Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Kirk Materne
Yes, thanks very much and I’ll echo the congrats on the acquisition",1.0
"Maybe starting there Sasan, I think it makes tons of sense in terms of the strategic vision and why you also want to leave Credit Karma on its own to continue its growth",0.9
"However, on the back end of the businesses, there is obviously a lot of potential synergies in terms of the data you’re both collecting, the ability to apply AI to that to drive greater synergies for both",0.0
So how are you thinking about sort of the independence factor versus some of the maybe combined benefits of bringing the businesses together from a data perspective,0.5
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Sure",0.1
"Thank you, Kirk for your question",1.0
Let me kick this off and I’ll let Ken chime in because the business plan that’s been developed has been jointly developed that will be executed after close,-0.1
"First of all, as I mentioned, there is alignment around mission and purpose and we’ve also aligned around priorities",0.1
"The priorities that we have aligned around is grow the core, it’s expand growth verticals and it’s developing emerging verticals and specifically, grow the core is really about growing credit cards and personal loans",0.8
"Expanding growth verticals is about auto and home loans and insurance and then developing emerging vertical is really about providing offerings like savings, checking and then over time early access to your paycheck, etcetera",0.4
So those are the three priorities that we have agreed to,0.0
"Now, what’s wonderful on behalf of consumers are the capabilities that we can bring together and so the first is creating a financial identity for the consumer",1.0
"What that means is the consumer now based on the data that we have the 50 million customers and 106 million customers that Credit Karma has, the consumer now has access to their data in one place, their income data, their spending data, their credit history data, their life situation",0.0
"I mean, Credit Karma has 2,600 data points for each of their customers on average and so creating a financial identity for the customer so they can use their data for their benefit is one thing that we will do together",0.9
"The second is making our money movement capabilities, the services available for Ken and the team",0.0
"That’s all of our risk and fraud capabilities that we use for same-day payroll, same day payments, all of that is necessary for Ken over time to be able to provide early access to consumers’ paychecks as an example",-1.0
"And then last but not least, we will make our financial data platform capabilities and services available to Ken so he can deliver benefits to customers and this is where we have 20,000 partners in our financial data platform where, again, all of this will be used with the customers consent and to their benefit",0.9
"So when I talk about allowing Ken to be in charge and running Credit Karma, we will make those data elements and services with the customers consent available on the back end so that ultimately Ken can deliver more benefit for Credit Karma customers over time and that’s where we see the acceleration and we don’t want to distract Ken and Credit Karma with anything else other than what’s most important to deliver for customers",0.9
So that’s the approach that we’re taking,0.0
"

Ken Lin
Yes",0.0
And maybe just to give you a little color on how you actually turn that into product when Sasan talked about income and the financial identity,0.0
One of the things that we observe in the space is that credit is a great predictor of underwriting about 80% of the time,1.0
"Income and assets is the other piece and as you may know, 81% of consumers – sub-prime consumers are declined for credit card offers",-0.4
"So if we actually have the full picture and the full financial identity of that consumer, we are able to provide them certainty in the space and again going back to this note of the most vulnerable people, when you apply for a credit product and you are declined, your score goes down and you get into this vicious cycle of getting into predatory lending of products that aren’t good for you",-1.0
"To Sasan’s note around the data platform, with it, we’ll be able to do things like automation of our cash flow",0.0
We’ll be able to audit – autonomous finance for us as moving money in such a way that you can minimize the interest that you’re paying,0.3
"You can move in a way that your credit score and your outstanding balances are at lowest so you can actually get those other products to help you get through life and then when it comes to you to access to the other data points, I think things like improving savings where you know approximately half the country don’t have $400 in savings",1.0
We can help improve that savings rates with our ability to foster money movement,0.9

Your question please,0.0

Kash Rangan
Hi, thank you very much",0.9
Sorry for my overhead noise here,-1.0
"The acquisition feels a little bit – it has a bit of a similarly to Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn where Microsoft bought a network and so you guys are buying effectively a network and Sasan and team, I’m just curious to get your thoughts on how we should think about the TAM – so the Intuit TAM has been a very simple one, TurboTax units multiplied by ASP, you add value, etcetera same thing with QuickBooks and this is a very different monetization model",0.1
"I’m curious to get your thoughts on how the monetization model I mean conceptually, I get the story, but from a long-term standpoint of building a multi-billion dollar business, how do we think about the monetization from a dollars and cents perspective",-0.1
I’m curious what synergies can Intuit bring to Credit Karma that Credit Karma could not do for itself,-0.1
Thank you so much and congratulations again,1.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Great",1.0
"Thank you, Kash",1.0
Let me hit on a couple of these and then I’m going to ask actually Ken to jump in and just share more around the business model,0.3
"First of all, this is really one view of having a network effect",-0.3
It’s truly solves a two-sided problem,-1.0
"The more consumers consent with their data being used at more financial institutions and others participate on the platform, the stronger the platform gets to deliver for the end consumer, the more choice that it provides and so from a network effect perspective, this has some of those characteristics",0.8
"In terms of synergy, it’s really what we were just describing earlier, really what you are now able to bring together with the two companies is the customers’ entire financial identity where they can use their data to get access to the best personal loans that are right for them, the best credit cards that are right for them, the best by the way, insurance, it could be home insurance, auto insurance, renters insurance because when the customer doesn’t have all their data in one place, they in essence have experiences that Ken was just talking about earlier where they may get something where they are pre-approved for, but when they actually try to go through the process, 80% of them get rejected and now by the data being in one place, it actually accelerates us delivering the benefits and that’s where the real synergy comes into places where we can do things together that we couldn’t do apart",1.0
"In terms of ASP, maybe let me let Ken just talk about the business model and how it works because that will be really the key characteristics moving forward",0.0
"

Ken Lin
Yes, first, maybe let me frame the problem in the industry",-1.0
So banks spend tens of billions of dollars each and every year marketing their financial services products and the challenge in the space is that each of those banks have a specific credit profile that they are looking for along with an ability to pay around income,-0.2
"Now imagine a bank that spends $100 million a year in marketing, maybe only 20% of those dollars are efficient because the other 80% go to people who are simply not qualified for that particular product",-1.0
"What we are able to do and speaking to this note around financial identity, we are able to help banks find those exactly right customers and I think that’s the problem that we solve for our financial services partners",0.9
"For the consumer, what they see is a landscape full of teaser rates, i",0.0
e,0.1
", rates that are for extremely well qualified buyers",1.0
You actually can’t tell if you’re an extremely well qualified buyer because the banks use hundreds of different variables to determine your eligibility and what we’re able to do is solve that particular problem for the consumer,-0.9
"So for our banking partners, they have access to a large scale of users that are highly qualified, for our members, we’re able to provide a service that gives them certainty and transparency of all the offers in the market and as a business model, what we do is we charge a success fee for when we’re able to match a consumer with the right financial services product and that is our business model and looking to capture all of those dollars that are being spent in digital and offline marketing today",0.1

Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Josh Beck
Thank you for taking the question",1.0
One of the things that the release stood out to me in the Credit Karma deck was the engagement and four times per month I think is quite strong,0.0
"I imagine TurboTax has good engagement, but it tends to be more seasonal",0.9
So maybe you could just talk a little bit about how you’ve gotten to those levels if it’s expanding verticals or finding more relevant offers and then the second part of my question is really tied to the competitive set with Credit Karma,0.1
"When I think about some of the longer-term items that Sasan mentioned, I’m just wondering, is it changing in that you’re competing maybe with a different audience than you used to",0.0
So would love to get some color on that,1.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Yes, great",1.0
Thank you for your question,1.0
Let me kick it off and then I’m going to turn it over to Ken to talk about all the incredible work they have done that drives all the engagement and then some of the new verticals that Ken described we’re going into,0.8
"I think to your first part of your question, from a strategic perspective, in context of going after the pain point of making ends meet, this really for the consumer front for the most part shifts us from engaging very infrequently and maybe once or twice a year to now engaging customers year round and delivering significant benefit and as we talked about earlier, you got 106 million members, 37 million that are monthly active and those that are monthly active, they engage four times a year and the excitement that we have around benefits that we can deliver and what’s possible in the long-term is the more offerings that we can provide truly becoming this financial assisted in the pocket of our customers where they can get access to credit cards at the best rates that are right for them, personal loans, home loans, auto loans, insurance whether it’s renters insurance or home insurance, savings accounts, early access to their paychecks that drives real benefit, real engagement and higher engagement over time, but what’s remarkable about the company, Ken and the team have created is it’s just at massive scale already",-1.0
"Now with that said, maybe Ken you can jump into engagement drivers",0.0
"

Ken Lin
Yes, absolutely",0.0
"So I think when we first started, people really questioned how engaging was the credit score and I think the reality is credit scores are something that take years to build and for many consumers, it is the hallmark of their financial health",-1.0
"So as a result, people tend to be very engaged in",0.0
"So, your credit score changes on average once per month",0.0
"We continue to add new products like credit monitoring, ID protection, Direct Dispute, which is a product that actually helps you to remove erroneous trade lines and debts from your credit report, the launch of our high yield savings product, all of these are product features that are created to help drive engagement, because we know consumers one, care about it, but two it’s an important aspect of our business model and a key business driver",-0.6

Congratulations all,0.8
"And Ken, if I could start off asking just the very last line of the pitch deck with regard to Credit Karma background, consumers on average use 1",0.0
"1 financial products a year, please define what that is, how you use that as a driver of the business, what you have done to improve it and what benefits you think might you gain now as part of the combination",0.7
"
Ken Lin
Yes",0.0
"One of the neat aspects of our business is we can actually see how many trade lines are originated each and every year and what we find is that on average, it is 1",1.0
"1 new trade lines and what that means is on average, a typical consumer will take out 1",0.0
"1 new credit card, new auto loan, auto refinance, a mortgage, a store credit card",0.0
"So anything that it shows and appears on your trade line, are on your credit report",0.0
"We get to see that and we know that, that average is 1",0.0
1,0.1
"Now specific to the business itself, what is really great is that it is highly predictable",1.0
"So, we are going on our 12th year of operation",0.1
"So, we have cohorts that go back 12 years and what we can see is that over time that consumers as they go through their lifecycle, their own life journey, they are able to sort of follow this pattern and we know that those credit originations are always in the market and we have an ability to both track our progress against it, but also anticipate what products consumers will need based on that rich data history that we have",0.1
"
Scott Schneeberger
Great, thanks",1.0
I appreciate that,1.0
"And then just shifting gears a little bit, Michelle, I guess I’ll bring you in here",0.0
It was strong EPS outperformance relative to your guide in the second quarter and then it looks like the third quarter guide is a little light,-0.9
"I saw the 300 basis points of operating margin expansion year-over-year in Small Business and Self-Employed, just curious if there is a pull forward, what’s driving the delta between the two quarters and just kind of some of the intricacies of this quarter and next",0.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Michelle Clatterbuck
Hey, Scott",0.1
Thanks,1.0
"First of all, I would say, when we really look at our expenses and our operating margin, we don’t get overly focused on quarter-by-quarter",-0.1
"So, we are really managing it, number one, on an annual basis and we’re also managing it – so that’s why, if you start to look at it quarter-by-quarter, you start to look at segment-by-segment, you might get a little wrapped up in some numbers that aren’t going to be as helpful to you",0.0
So we are focusing on total year at the company level,0.0
"Yes, we did come in with operating expenses a little lower in Q2 and some of that is really being driven by different investment decisions we are making and also driven by some staffing and staffing cost and so forth that came in a little lighter in Q2, but we are not changing our full year operating income guidance",0.0
And so I wouldn’t get too focused on the individual quarters,-0.1

Thanks very much for taking my question",1.0
"In terms of the current members of Credit Karma obviously I saw the number is $106 million, it’s a huge number",0.0
"And just thinking in terms of overlap with TurboTax, can you talk about what that might look like in any way that you can through integrations or anything kind of in the workforce, people go through those apps that they could – there is a cross-sell opportunity to either platform",0.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Yes, it’s not something at this point that we even know what the overlap is and one that we can communicate",0.0
"All we can tell you is when we look at what’s possible based on the benefits that we can deliver for customers, there is a lot of upside and we are excited about the opportunity, but it’s not something at this point that we even have the data to share with you",1.0
"
Chris Merwin
Got it",0.5
"And just a quick follow-up on marketing, I know last quarter you talked about a pull forward on marketing spend to reach some of the early filers for TurboTax and looking at the consumer revenue growth rate, I think it was up 8% in the quarter, that’s just below the full year guidance",0.7
So can you talk about some of the moving pieces in the quarter for consumer and your confidence level on I guess it represents an acceleration there into 3Q,0.3
Thanks,1.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Sure, sure",0.0
"Well, first of all, I am confident in our strategy",1.0
"I am confident in our execution and what we are seeing and as I mentioned earlier, we’re growing the category, we’re taking share and knock on wood, our teams have done an incredible job with the experiences that we’re delivering for customers",1.0
So that’s bucket one,0.0
"Bucket two is very similar to what you heard from, Michelle there is only a few days of e-file revenue in that number",-0.1
"So actually, our marketing dollar spend and our revenue are not really correlated",-0.1
It’s really the number of days of open e-file and you will see our full year results after we get through after we get through the next season,0.0
"We are seeing better traction than even last year when it comes to raising awareness, consideration and just a return that we are getting on our marketing dollars",1.0

Daniel Jester

Thank you for taking my question,1.0
"Just going back to Credit Karma, obviously it affects one of your five big bets, but how should we think about how you are prioritizing kind of incremental investments in the other four big bets over the next year or two while you are focused on closing this transaction and integration",-0.1
And I guess I am getting at is should we view this as kind of one really big bet and four medium-sized bets over the next year or two,0.0
"And then I guess secondly, does this acquisition preclude you from doing anything kind of smaller or bolt-on in the rest of the business from an acquisition perspective",0.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Yes, great",1.0
Thank you for the question,1.0
"So first of all when we declared these five big bets and as we shared at Investor Day, they are grounded in fairly large customer problems that are very durable and areas where we believe that it’s our obligation and our right to solve these customer problems and it’s very durable and it also will result in the largest growth drivers for the company",-1.0
"In a couple of the bets, our gaps are probably larger than the other bets",0.0
"First of all, they are all created equal, the five big bets, but we have deliberately stack ranked them the way we have, because we believe that if we had to make trade-off choices that we could be crystal clear how we would make trade-off choices",-0.6
We have stacked all five bets to win internally,0.9
"We made some significant investment in capital reallocations in the last year and we continue to do so to ensure that these big bets are resourced to win and with that as context, it actually doesn’t change our M&amp;A principles",0.9
I wouldn’t conclude that we now have four large acquisitions coming because we have four other big bets,0.0
"This is really about following our acquisition or our M&amp;A principles around one of the largest customer problems and what are the gaps that we have and are there opportunities for us to be able to close that gap and increase speed to market and it just so happened that this bet, because really it’s about serving consumers and helping them make ends meet that this just from our perspective is a great opportunity to bring two companies together to achieve greatness for our end customers",-1.0
So that’s the way I would think about it,0.0
Our M&amp;A principles have not changed,0.0
"Every bet is resourced to win, this was one of them where we felt like there is an opportunity to increase and improve speed the market",1.0

Just as context and a reminder, the Free File program is a philanthropic effort and we abide by the Memorandum of Understanding along with other industry players, which might have reaffirmed when the report was published I think in the fall and with that as context, we don’t see anything outside of the norm, based on the way the season is playing out this year in FFA",1.0

"Looking at some of the available information here, it looks like the Credit Karma revenue base has been slowing over the past couple of years",-0.3
"It sounds like some of what Sasan and Ken have already mentioned here around data and financial partners can help stabilize that trajectory, but maybe it would be useful to hear more from Ken’s perspective around how this combination of Credit Karma and the Intuit ecosystem can help stabilize and maybe even improve that trajectory going forward",1.0
Thank you,1.0
"
Ken Lin
Sure",0.0
"So if you really look at you know the history of Credit Karma, what we have been focused on, I often think about the first 12 years of our history as really helping consumers save money when they borrow, i",1.0
e,0.1
", investing in our credit cards vertical, in our mortgage vertical, in our auto lending vertical",0.0
"As we continue to grow, we have now focused on the other side of the balance sheet, i",0.0
e,0.1
", high yield savings and other asset plays and what’s key for our platform goes back to this note around engagement and the way that we think about accelerating revenue and what our models show is that the more engagement we have, there is a direct correlation to our revenue and where the opportunities come in is that a lot of the financial identity components that the combination of Credit Karma and Intuit have together, those are big growth drivers of engagement and we believe that over time that will both drive the SDUs or sort of the engagement numbers that we track, which leads to monetization and our ability to move into other verticals outside of traditional credit cards and personal loans",0.2

Thanks,1.0
Hey guys,0.1
This is Jackson Ader on Sterling tonight,0.2
"Just a quick follow-up on that last answer you gave, Ken, should we be thinking maybe about the growth forward coming more from having the monthly active members increase as a percent of the total number of members or will it be that total membership growth and the monthly active members should grow about in line with that",1.0
"
Ken Lin
I don’t have an exact breakout but we know that both are both extremely important aspects of our business",0.0
"One of the nice key points of our business is any given quarter, approximately 90% of our revenues are repeating users or members that registered from prior quarters i",0.8
e,0.1
", 10% are from new users",0.0
So we see a combination,0.0
"Our ability to drive new users drives revenue and our ability to drive existing users back drive revenue, so both are really important and fundamental to the business model and the key metrics that we track",0.0
"

Sasan Goodarzi
And if I could just add one thing, this is just from a go forward perspective, I think what’s very just remarkable with respect to the company that Ken has built is when you have 106 million customers or members that use you, trust you, and you ultimately give the customer the ability to be able to leverage their data to be able to benefit from more and more choice, the opportunity that we have over time and again, Ken started the company with credit cards, personal loans, and now auto and home, but auto and home loans and insurance is actually kind of just at the beginning of what’s possible",1.0
"Then, there is this new vertical that’s around savings, getting early access to your paycheck over time",0.0
"So what I want you all to imagine is this truly being a consumer finance platform where it serves as a financial assistant in the pocket of consumers and the more we can deliver more benefits, the more engagement we drive over time and the more we can actually help financial services industry members be efficient and then therefore drive up ARPU and revenue and so this is just there’s kind of many years of opportunity to capture the TAM that we described earlier",1.0
"
Ken Lin
Yes",0.0
One final note is that a lot of that data is highly scalable,0.0
So the data that is used to determine your eligibility for credit card to a personal loan to a mortgage tends to be the same,0.0
"So as we move into new verticals, your cost basis is relatively fixed, but you get a bunch of scale out of those operating cost basis",0.0
"So as you’re moving into new verticals, you often times get to expand your margins",0.0

Jackson Ader
Okay, that makes a lot of sense",0.2
Just a quick follow-up,0.0
"So the last couple of years maybe, has that monthly active member number – has that grown in line with revenue, maybe below the revenue growth rate or even above",0.6
"
Ken Lin
Yes",0.0
"Historically, our engagement numbers have grown slightly faster than revenue and what we tend to find is our ability to launch new products like ID protection, Direct Dispute and the ones I mentioned before, high yield savings",0.8
"We know that these directly correlate to the overall engagement of our user base, which is why we are so focused on driving an excellent customer experience, because we know those two things are highly correlated",1.0

Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research,0.0
Your line is open,0.0
"
Kartik Mehta
Hey, Sasan, you talked about engagement maybe throughout the year with the TurboTax customers now that you have the Credit Karma platform or will have the Credit Karma platform",0.1
"So I am wondering, will you change the branding or how will the branding work so that customers know that Credit Karma is part of the Intuit family",0.0
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Yes, what we will do is when we, just like today, when we raise awareness and if it’s TurboTax or if it’s QuickBooks, you see Intuit, you see QuickBooks by Intuit or TurboTax by Intuit",0.2
"So over time, we’ll work with Ken and make sure that over time people know that Credit Karma is part of Intuit",0.1
What we won’t do is change the brand of Credit Karma,-0.1
"It’s established an incredible brand, it stands for choice and benefits for consumers and that is something that we wouldn’t change because it has got a strong brand like QuickBooks or TurboTax has",1.0
"
Kartik Mehta
And then you mentioned one of the opportunities is to leverage some of the information now that customers have with their tax returns and I’m wondering what type of success you have or what percentage of customers are allowing you to use their financial information from a tax return so that you can assist them in other areas",0.9
"
Sasan Goodarzi
Yes, if you recall, one of the things we shared at Investor Day, so it’s a high number",0.0
"At Investor Day, we shared that we have 37 million registered users that have actually agreed for their data to be used for benefits for them and then we have 4 million active users",0.5
"So, consumers are very much willing to consent for their data to be used for their benefit as long as they are in control of it and so we’ve actually seen very nice traction since we’ve launched Turbo",1.0
"

Kartik Mehta
And then just one last question, Michelle, if you look – I know you don’t want to give out financial information on Credit Karma other than maybe revenue, but if you look at the revenue profile, the margin profile of Credit Karma, is it at, above or below kind of corporate averages for Intuit",-0.1
"
Michelle Clatterbuck
Hey Kartik, you are right we are actually not in a position to give out any of the profitability information for Credit Karma",0.5
"However, we do believe they are a platform and they have been driving some great engagement and scale and so we think that that’s a great thing, but yes, we aren’t actually able to share any of that information",1.0
"Thank you, though",1.0
"
Kartik Mehta
No worries",1.0
Thank you,1.0

"So first of all, thank you very much for all the questions and everybody’s time today",1.0
"I am truly excited for the progress that we are making, the acceleration that we have ahead with Credit Karma and I would just like to close by thanking our employees",1.0
"Last week, we were named the number 11 in Fortune’s Top 100 Companies to Work For in the U",0.1
S,-0.1

I would now like to turn the conference over to Al Kildani, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Halozyme Therapeutics",0.2
Mr,0.1
"Kildani, please begin",0.1
"
Al Kildani
Thank you",1.0
Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results conference call,1.0
"In addition to our press release issued today after the close, you can find a supplementary slide presentation that will be referenced during today’s call on the Investor Relations section of our website",0.0
"
Leading the call today will be Dr",0.0
"Helen Torley, Halozyme’s President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an update on our business and review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019",0.0
"
During the call we will be making forward-looking statements",0.0
I refer you to our SEC filings for a full listing of the risks and uncertainties,-1.0
"
I’ll now turn the call over to Helen",0.1
"
Helen Torley
Thank you, Al",1.0
"Before providing an update on our recent progress and outlook, I’d like to first comment on the leadership change we’ve just announced",1.0
"I’m very excited to announce that Elaine Sun has been appointed our new Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective March 2",0.7
"
Elaine joined Halozyme with a tremendous background in investment banking having played key roles in strategic and financing transactions valued in excess of $50 billion during her career",0.7
"Most recently Elaine has served as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer of SutroVax, which is a private biopharmaceutical company developing vaccines to fight infectious diseases",-0.9
"
Elaine’s deep knowledge and experience of corporate finance and also in M&amp;A transactions will be of great value as we focus on driving the long-term growth and profitability of Halozyme",1.0
I look forward very much to working closely with Elaine and to introducing her to you on our next quarterly call,0.6
"
And I’d also like to just take a moment to thank Laurie for her contributions to Halozyme, and particularly for the key role she played in helping the company through the restructuring over the last few months",1.0
We wish Laurie all the best in her next role,1.0
"
I’m now pleased to provide an update on our recent progress and 2020 plan",1.0
We’ve completed virtually all of the closeout actions related to our former oncology operations and are now focused solely on our ENHANZE business,0.1
"The swift repositioning of the company and the decisive cost reduction measures taken, have placed Halozyme on a path to sustainable, near-term profitability with anticipated high growth in revenues, earnings and cash flows expected for the next several years",0.3
This makes Halozyme a unique biotechnology company as one of the few combining high-growth potential and the ability to provide a meaningful return of capital,0.7
"
As we announced in January, for 2020 our revenue guidance is $230 million to $245 million, at which we’d represent 17% to 25% growth over 2019",0.0
"The key driver for this revenue growth is milestone revenue, resulting from the strong projected partner development progress and new product commercialization",0.4
"

Earnings per share guidance is $0",0.0
60 to $0,0.0
"75, and I’m pleased to announce that we have completed the first $200 million of the share repurchase of our announced three-year plan to repurchase a total of $550 million worth of stock by the end of 2022",1.0
"With this initial repurchase completed, we’re now planning an additional share repurchase of up to $150 million worth of shares by the end of 2020, pending market conditions and other factors",0.1
"
Let me now provide a brief overview of our ENHANZE platform and our business model before providing specifics on our progress",0.4
"
We licensed our ENHANZE technology to leading global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for exclusive co-formulation with their proprietary products on a target-by-target basis",0.0
"We received upfront payments, development and commercial milestones, and on average a mid-single digit royalty on net sales",0.0
"
To-date, we have licensed our rHuPH20 enzyme to nine leading pharmaceutical and biotech companies, covering over 50 potential drug targets in total",0.0
The growth in the number of partners and the expansion and progress of products and development with ENHANZE has resulted in the generation of data that illustrate the exciting range of competitive differentiation opportunity that ENHANZE may bring to our partners,0.3
"
Among these new potential benefits are the potential for a lower rate of infusion-related reactions as was observed with DARZALEX SC and the COLUMBA Phase III study, when compared to the rate observed with DARZALEX IV; the potential for new pricing approaches, for example for those combining two biologics with ENHANZE",0.3
"As Roche has previously stated, this may be an opportunity for the Perjeta-Herceptin fixed-dose combination; the ability to facilitate the administration of treatment in lower cost settings such as the physician office or the community",0.1
"
Janssen as an example has stated DARZALEX SC supports their strategy to seek to expand treatment into the community setting; and as a last example, the ability to simplify administration by moving from a fixed-dose versus weight-based dosing",0.3
This has been demonstrated with RITUXAN and has been observed with DARZALEX too,0.0
We look forward to these differentiating elements of our ENHANZE technology being further demonstrated as additional products are commercialized,0.5
"
Let me now move to an update on our most advanced programs",0.2
"We’re very excited for the next few anticipated launches of products utilizing ENHANZE, as they are expected to represent an important inflection point for our royalty revenue growth",1.0
I’ll begin with slide three or with daratumumab or DARZALEX,0.0
"
DARZALEX represents an exciting growth opportunity",1.0
"In its current IV form, DARZALEX experienced approximately 45% growth globally in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is currently projected by analysts to reach $3",0.0
9 billion in sales in 2020 and over $6 billion in sales in 2024,0.0
"
Janssen has stated that subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX is a core part of their future growth strategy, supporting their goals of expansion into the frontline setting in addition to treatment in the community setting",0.7
Janssen completed regulatory submissions in the U,-0.1
S,-0.1
"and in EU for the subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX in July of 2019, setting up the potential for approval in the mid-2020 timeframe, assuming standard regulatory review times",0.0
"
The potential value proposition of daratumumab SC is strong",0.2
"Based on the COLUMBA Phase III data, daratumumab SC can be given in a three to five minutes subcutaneously, versus three to four hours for the IV, and in the study there was also a lower rate of infusion-related reactions reported with the SC at approximately 13% compared with approximately 35% or the IV",-0.9
"
Turning now to slide four, the fixed-dose combination of Perjeta and Herceptin is the next potential launch of a product utilizing ENHANZE",0.0
"According to Roche’s fourth quarter financial results, Perjeta IV sales experienced 16% global growth, driven by continued uptake of the affinity indication in early breast cancer",-1.0
Analysts currently project $4,0.0
"2 billion in global sales in 2020 for Perjeta, going to more than $5 billion in 2024",0.0
"

Roche has completed regulatory filings in the U",0.0
S,-0.1
and EU and its BLA submission was recently accepted by the FDA,-0.5
Roche has stated they expect to launch in the U,0.0
S,-0.1
"in 2020 and we would anticipate launch in the EU in 2021, following the approval",0.0
"The subcutaneous fixed-dose combination of Perjeta and Herceptin is an important first, combining two therapeutic antibodies in a single fixed-dose formulation, utilizing ENHANZE, enabling a five minute to eight minute subcutaneous injection, compared with 1",0.0
5 hours to 2,0.0
5 hours for the sequential IV administration of Herceptin and Perjeta,0.0
"
During the recent fourth quarter update, Roche indicated that uptake of subcutaneous Herceptin has been impacted in part because of preferred regimen for Herceptin is now with Perjeta IV, whether in the metastatic disease setting or in early breast cancer",-1.0
"With the availability of both drugs in a fixed-dose subcutaneous formulation, they further stated that the savings in treatment time could prove to be a big advantage for patients",0.2
"
These next two launches are for drugs at a very different time point in their growth cycle compared with the drugs currently commercialized utilizing ENHANZE",0.7
"DARZALEX and Perjeta are both multi-billion dollar products, where the IV form of the drug still enjoys high-double digit growth and has a long runway on its intellectual property",0.4
"
Moving now to slide five, outlined here is our robust pipeline of ENHANZE partnered products that are in development",0.8
There are nine partner programs currently in or that have completed Phase I testing,0.0
"Let me begin with efgartigimod from our newest partner Argenx, who continues to make rapid progress advancing this program in combination with our ENHANZE technology",0.5
"
In December, Argenx announced results from its Phase I study, evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of efgartigimod using ENHANZE in healthy volunteers",0.3
"Argenx stated the based on these results, together with their internal analysis, it plans to explore the potential for a one minute injection potentially given every two weeks",-0.2
"
Argenx is moving rapidly with development and recently stated it initiated a Phase II study of efgartigimod with ENHANZE in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy or CIDP; it is a form of chronic autoimmune neuropathy",-0.6
"
The Phase II study has an innovative design intended to result in a faster time to a go/no-go decision for advancement of potential Phase III study",0.2
"In addition, Argenx is evaluating a bridging strategy for efgartigimod with ENHANZE in myasthenia gravis",0.0
"
With regard to ALXN1810, Alexion recently disclosed plans to start a Phase II Renal Basket study with 1810 in the second half of 2020",0.0
"
Moving now to Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are very pleased with their progress, as Bristol-Myers is now in the clinic with three exclusive targets, PD1 or nivolumab, anti-CD73, and a Phase I study is under way, evaluating a combination of nivolumab plus relatlimab",1.0
"And completing this overview of disclosed targets, Roche has initiated Phase I study evaluating ENHANZE with Tecentriq and OCREVUS",-0.1
"Overall, from this group of Phase I programs, we project three Phase III trial starts and one Phase II trial start in 2020",0.0
"
In addition, and as shown on the right hand side of the slide, we project at least five new Phase I starts in 2020, which would result in 10 ongoing Phase I trials by the end of the year",0.0
"And I’m also delighted to announce today a new target nomination by Janssen, who has selected the targets EGFR and cMET as part of a bispecific antibody being studied in solid tumors",0.6
We are obviously excited to work in another program with Janssen and to expand the success of our collaboration,1.0
"
With these anticipated developments, 2020 is expected to be a year of significant progress across our ENHANZE development program, and all of this progress is resulting in substantial revenue opportunity",0.6
"

Moving now to slide six, we project cumulative milestone revenues for the three-year period, 2020 to 2022 to be $350 million to $450 million",0.0
"This growth in projected milestones has been driven by the larger milestone payments associated with new target approvals and the increase in the number of products advancing to a later stage development, many of which are also associated with larger milestones",0.0
This near-term milestone revenue precedes the royalty revenues and is an important and strong indicator for future royalty revenue potential,0.0
"
Now moving to the royalties, which are shown on slide seven, we project the potential for approximately $1 billion in royalty revenue in 2027, based on the currently approved products those pending regulatory review, and those anticipated to be in clinical development by the end of 2020",0.1
"
This is a non-risk adjusted number and assumes approvals in multiple indications, global launches, and on average in mid-single digit royalty on net sales of ENHANZE formulated products, and this number does not reflect any potential contribution from new collaborations or additional target selections from our additional partners that have not yet been made",-0.6
"I can say we remain in active dialog with potential new enhanced partners, ranging from large pharmaceutical companies to development stage by technology companies",0.4
"
I’ll turn now to slide eight, and our strong financial position and diversified revenue streams form our capital allocation priorities",0.1
"Our first priority is to drive growth in our ENHANZE business, by maximizing the value of our current collaborations and working to sign new collaboration partners",0.8
"
With the strong projected free cash flow, our next priority is returning capital to investors via share repurchases",0.8
"We’ve completed $200 million worth of share repurchase, leading $350 million available under the $550 million three-year share repurchase program, which was authorized by our Board of Directors in November of 2019",0.0
"
We plan to repurchase up to an additional $150 million worth of shares during 2020, pending market conditions and other factors",0.0
"As you can see, we have a strong commitment to capital return, and we will also evaluate the potential to adding new technology platform through acquisition with the goal of accelerating our long-term revenue growth",0.7
"In evaluating this, we are seeking an approach that is the high-growth and high-margin profiles like our ENHANZE business",0.8
"
I’d like to turn to slide nine for a discussion of our fourth quarter financial results",0.9
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $53,-0.1
7 million compared with $60,0.0
2 million in the prior year period,0.0
"This 11% decrease was primarily driven by a $25 million upfront payment from Roche in the fourth quarter of 2018, which was partially offset by higher product sales",-0.4
"
Royalty revenue for the quarter was $17",0.0
"2 million, a decrease of 11%, primarily driven by lower sales of Herceptin SC by Roche, reflecting the ongoing impact from biosimilars",0.0
Product sales of $22,0.0
7 million in the quarter compared to $10,0.0
"7 million in the prior year period, up mainly due to an increase in the sale of bulk rHuPH20 to Janssen",0.0
We continue to expect that product sales of API will fluctuate in future periods based on the needs of our collaboration partners,0.1
"
Collaboration revenue in the quarter totaled $13",0.0
7 million compared to $30,0.0
"2 million a year ago, with the difference primarily attributable to the Roche upfront payment in the fourth quarter of 2018 that I referenced a moment ago",-0.1
"
On slide 10, you will find a more detailed breakdown of our fourth quarter P&amp;L",0.0
"I’ll begin with the total operating expenses, which were $85",0.0
"7 million in the fourth quarter, up from $60",0.0
3 million in the prior year period,0.0
I’ll address the increase in total operating expenses by discussing each of the components,0.0
"

As a result of higher API shipments to ENHANZE partners, cost of product sales were $16",-0.1
"7 million, up from $5",0.0
6 million in the prior year period,0.0
Research and development expenses of $45,0.0
1 million increased from $36,0.0
"7 million in the prior year period, reflecting $17",0.0
2 million in restructuring and one-time charges related to the shift in strategic focus of the company to the ENHANZE delivery technology,0.0
This was partially offset by $9,-0.4
4 million lower PEGPH20 clinical trial related costs,0.0
"
SG&amp;A expenses were $23",0.0
"9 million, up from $18 million in the prior year, primarily due to restructuring and other one-time charges of $11",0.0
"2 million, partially offset by lower personnel costs",-0.1
Net loss for the quarter was $34,-1.0
4 million or $0,0.0
"24 per share, compared to a net loss of $2",-0.1
1 million or $0,0.0
01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018,0.0
"
I’ll turn now to slide 11, with a snapshot of the full-year 2019 results",0.0
Total revenue for 2019 was $196 million compared with $151,-0.1
"9 million in 2018, representing strong growth of 29%",0.2
"The biggest contributor to this increase was higher product sales, driven by API sales to our ENHANZE partners",0.1
"Total product sales were $66 million in the year, up from $28",-0.5
2 million in 2018,0.0
Net loss for the year was $72,-0.9
"2 million, down from $80",-0.1
3 million for 2018,0.0
This translated to a loss per share for the year of $0,-0.7
50 compared with $0,-0.5
56 for 2018,0.0
"
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $421",-0.1
"3 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $354",0.0
"5 million at December 31, 2018",0.0
"The increase in cash balance year-over-year resulted from actions we took late in 2019 to recapitalize the company, which allowed us to lower our cost of capital, pay off the remaining balance for our outstanding loans from the Oxford and Silicon Valley Banks, and initiate our capital return program with the front-loaded share repurchase",0.2
"
In November of 2019, we completed the sale of $460 million in aggregate principal amount of 1",0.0
"25% convertible senior notes, which are due in 2024 in a private placement to qualified investors, which resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately $447 million",0.0
"We used some of these proceeds to initiate our capital return program, repurchasing approximately $143 million worth of shares and privately negotiated transactions related to the convertible note offering",0.4
"
Following that, we repurchased $7 million worth of shares in the open market and implemented a $50 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was recently completed",0.0
"In total, we have repurchased $200 million worth of shares or 11",0.0
"1 million shares, since first announcing our capital return program",0.1
"We have $350 million remaining on our Board approved share repurchase program, and as stated, we intend to repurchase up to $150 million worth of additional shares during 2020",0.0
"
The amount and the timing of the share repurchase during 2020 will be subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions, other business considerations and applicable legal requirements",0.0
"
Let me turn now to slide 12, for a more detailed discussion of our financial guidance",0.1
"We first announced our financial guidance in January 14, and it remains unchanged",0.0
"We expect total revenues to be in the range of $230 million to $245 million, which would represent 17% to 25% growth over 2019",-0.1
"
As discussed earlier, the key driver of revenue in 2020 is milestones, as a result of the projected number and size of the milestone payments related to new target approval and products advancing to late-stage development in 2020",0.0
These clearly proceeded royalty revenues from these products and are certainly a strong indicator for the future potential royalty revenue,0.6
"
Near term, in 2020 we expect a modest decline in royalty revenue as a result of ongoing biosimilar impact on Roche products",0.4
"Earnings per share, is expected to be in the range of $0",0.0
60 to $0,0.0
"75 on a GAAP basis, and we continue to project that the first quarter of sustainable profitability will be the second quarter of 2020",0.1
"

And with regard to the expense structure, we expect to achieve annualized operating expenses, excluding cost of goods sold, of $65 million to $75 million by the fourth quarter",-0.8
"As you have just heard, Halozyme is in a strong financial position as a company focused solely on ENHANZE today, with profitability on the horizon and a demonstrated commitment to maximize value for our shareholders by the return of capital to our investors",0.2
"With the transition to an ENHANZE focused business virtually complete, we are in a strong position to deliver additional value to our shareholders as we anticipate a number of significant events to occur in 2020, and these are summarized on slide 13",0.1
"
They include the potential, regulatory approvals and launches of the subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX in both the U",0.0
S,-0.1
and the EU; the potential FDA approval and U,0.0
S,-0.1
launch of the subcutaneous fixed-dose combination of Perjeta and Herceptin; three new Phase III trial starts; one new Phase II trial start; five new targets entering Phase I study; and profitability beginning in the second quarter,0.0
"
With key milestones on the horizon and a clear path toward sustainable growth in revenues, earnings and cash flow, Halozyme is in a strong position to deliver additional value to shareholders",0.5
"Our unique financial model, powered by substantial anticipated milestone payments in the future, growing royalty revenue stream also allows us to return meaningful value to our shareholders, while supporting our growth objectives, and I’d say none of this would be possible without the strong and talented Halozyme team, and I’d like to end the call just by thanking everyone at Halozyme for your tremendous efforts and for the strong results",0.8
"
With that, I’d be delighted now to take your questions",1.0
"Operator, would you please open the call",0.0

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Yes",0.0
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Charles Duncan with Cantor Fitzgerald,0.0
"
Charles Duncan
Hi",0.0
"Helen and Laurie and team, congrats on a great year of progress",1.0
"I had a couple of questions regarding some of the, I guess guidance, particularly the milestones looking out ‘20 to ‘22",0.0
I’m wondering if you could provide any granularity on what comprises those milestones,0.0
"I know you probably won’t be able to talk about specific numbers associated with certain milestones, but are you expecting both, dara and the fixed-dose combination for Perjeta-Herceptin to be approved here in the near term, as well as what number of the projected Phase 3’s and the one Phase 2 trial start would you anticipate to be approved by the end of ‘22",0.0
"
Helen Torley
Yeah, thanks Charles",1.0
"With regard to the milestones, the way to think about it is it’s growing because of the increase in maturity of our portfolio and so it is being driven by anticipated product launches and Phase 3 starts as you mentioned, because those tend to be associated with higher milestones",0.0
"
We haven’t provided any specifics, other than we do anticipate the approval for daratumumab in the U",0.0
S,-0.1
and the EU in 2020,0.0
"For Perjeta-Herceptin, while we do anticipate a U",0.0
S,-0.1
approval at the end of 2020 that is not associated with the milestone,-0.1
"
Just as a reminder, we already received the milestone for the HER2 product",0.9
"But then if we move to our expectations for the year, we are projecting a total of some three Phase 3 starts, one Phase 2 start, and five new Phase 1 starts, many, but not all of which are associated milestones",-0.2
But it’s that very nice mix from the approvals through the late-stage products to the early stage products over the next several years and the progress we’re going to see with those products that are entering the clinic move into later stage that is driving the very robust projected milestone potential,1.0
"

Charles Duncan
That’s helpful",1.0
"And related to that, would you anticipate – is the base case assumption that you’re making is that DARZALEX SC would be approved just as a reflection of the current approval or could it be approved for a broader label",0.0
It would seem to me that ENHANZE could really enable that,0.0
"

Yeah Charles, I think that’s a question we don’t know the answer to",-0.4
"We certainly know that Janssen submitted the file to include the COLUMBA study, which was in relapsed-refractory patients, but also the PLEIADES study, which included patients who were in the front and second line settings as well",-1.0
"
At the RITUXAN HYCELA Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee, the FDA had suggested it may be possible based on smaller studies to be able to get a broader label, but we simply don’t know the answer to that as yet, but I’m certainly hopeful that the FDA is going to allow for a broader label, but we’ll have to wait the FDA decision on that",0.8

Charles Duncan
Okay, last question quickly",0.1
"When you think about ‘27 or revenues beyond ‘27, specifically royalty revenues, could you help us think through that, and would it depend on being able to access a new platform or do you think that there is some sustained royalty revenues from the existing enhanced platform beyond ‘27",1.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Helen Torley
Yeah",0.2
"I mean, if I begin just with ENHANZE post-2027, that really is – what the pattern is after ‘27 is going to depend on a number of things, some of which we simply don’t know today",0.0
How many new partners we will have signed by then,0.0
"How many new products are in development and how many new co-formulation patents have been signed, all of which will have the effect to add additional revenue and extend the duration of time of which we would get revenue",0.0
"
So it is very hard to predict exactly what will happen after 2027 with ENHANZE, but I do think what is very clear is even after the expiry of the U",-1.0
S,-0.1
"patent in 2027, the structure of our contracts together with the potential for co-formulation patents means that we do not anticipate a royalty cliff, and a dramatic reduction in sales immediately",-0.1
"
Now, you’re asking about the platform, but indeed it is our strategy to continue to the growth in that ’24, ‘27 to ‘30 time frame",0.2
That is exactly what we’ll be looking to find with something to add on that will continue to add to the exciting growth we have with ENHANZE,1.0
"
We obviously are just beginning to look at that",0.0
We don’t feel any rush to do that Charles,0.0
"It’s important that we see the success of ENHANZE and the very rapid growth we expect from that in the next several years, but we will be looking to add something to do exactly what you say, add on to that growth in the ‘24 and onwards years",1.0

Unidentified Analyst
Very good afternoon, everyone",1.0
This is T,-0.1
J,0.2
[ph] speaking for Do,0.0
Congrats on the continued progress,1.0
I have a couple of quick questions,0.0
The first one is in relation to the operating expense,0.0
Do you view that growing in correlation with the increased number of partnerships,0.0
"Is there some type of expected growth rate that we can imply in our models or do you think it’s going to be pretty flat moving forward, given that you’ve had this restructuring completed or near completion",1.0
"
And then my second question is in relation to some of the economics of the royalties and milestones",0.0
"Do you foresee that in the future increasing, as in being able to attain higher milestone upfront payments as opposed to kind of what you’ve been averaging over the past few years",0.1
Thank you,1.0
"
Helen Torley
Yeah, thanks for those questions",1.0
"With regard to the ENHANZE business model, what is terrific about it is how leverageable it is",1.0
"If you recall a couple of calls ago, I did an illustration of that and where the majority of our expenses come from are our internal experts",0.0
"Our teams who support the alliance partners, and because they support partners at different stages, they can move in and out of programs and across partners and so this is what makes our business so leverageable",1.0
"

So we do anticipate that as we – in the near term as we contemplate the expended number of partners and the number of programs, we will not need to increase our expenses",0.0
"If we do happen to have a large increase in the number of partners and programs, we would have to modestly need to add a few people",0.0
But you could think about that $65 billion to $75 million expense range I gave you as certainly being in place for the near term based on our current projections for growth,0.9
"
With regard to the structure of the upcoming agreements that we may sign, we do feel that with the current structure we have, where we receive in general as an example, $30 million as an upfront for a single target, $160 million in milestones and then the mid-single digit royalties, is going to be the ongoing range",0.0
"
We saw a big step change in the value of our contracts in 2014 into 2015 after we had demonstrated commercial and regulatory success and we’re very happy with the value we get with our current partners and obviously it’s resulting in the very exciting financial picture for the company",1.0
"So I would think about it as being in a similar range to what we’ve seen with the last several contracts, examples including argenx and Alexion",0.0

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Butler with JMP Securities",0.0

Jason Butler
Hi, thanks for taking the question",0.8
Just one on the J&amp;J program,0.0
Can you just give us a little bit more background on where the product – the candidate is in development and the path forward from here with ENHANZE,0.0
"And then just more broadly speaking, any technical considerations when using the technology with the bispecific antibody versus a monoclonal",0.0
Thanks,1.0

Helen Torley
Yeah, thank you",1.0
"Jason, unfortunately we’re not in a position just based on Janssen not really have talked much about this program to be able to provide any details on its development or anything else at this point in time",-1.0

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo",0.0
"
Jim Birchenough
Yes, hi guys",0.0
Congrats on all the progress,1.0
I guess a couple of questions,0.0
The first is just on Elaine’s hire,-0.1
"Could you maybe just comment, it seems like with her background that might be indicative of more deal making going forward, and so could you maybe confirm that",0.0
"
And I guess the second related part is, when you talk about accessing other technologies to support growth longer term in high-margin technology platforms, what’s your sensitivity to those deals being accretive or at least not dilutive, because I think there’s some concern that you might do a dilutive deal",0.5
"
Helen Torley
Yeah, and thanks Jim for that",1.0
"If I can talk about Elaine first, I mean obviously with her strong investment banking experience, she has got deal experience",0.7
"Now equally what I found was that she is a highly strategic CFO, with a great deal of insights on capital markets",1.0
"And as we think about the future picture of Halozyme with our expectations for increasing free cash flow, it is as much that a focus we have on identifying the right capital return and evolving our capital return plan that I hired Elaine for as an M&amp;A deal experience",1.0
"
So earlier I mentioned that near term we’re very focused on ENHANZE, having someone of her deal experience will ofcourse be very helpful, but I think about it being as much a focus on the capital return as it is on the deal side of things",0.9
"
You know good question, Jim",1.0
We focused on the new deal wanting it to have a strong impact on the top line growth,0.9
We obviously are going to be very sensitive to the impact on the earnings growth as well,0.5
So we’ll be looking at both of those factors as we contemplate bringing in the digital platform to increase the value of Halozyme and the return for our shareholders,0.1
"

Jim Birchenough
And then maybe just one more question, sort of following on an earlier question about the tail beyond 2027",0.0
Can you say if you’ve filed or your partners have filed per co-formulation patents,0.0
"Are there any pending that we should be aware of, and what’s the strategy there overall when we think about the portfolio",0.0
Do you have a potential strategy for each co-formulated asset,0.3
"
Helen Torley
Yeah, we don’t have any pending co-formulation patents at this point in time, Jim",0.0
"We do have a team who works with each of our partners to discuss the potential points of novelty that are being identified either in the Phase I study or in the clinical studies, and work with them for them to submit the patent applications and so…
I think I may have mentioned, maybe last year it was, we brought in an outside law firm to just brainstorm all of the different points of differentiation that could be considered novel, and there’s a wide range of them that go from pharmacokinetic factors to pharmacodynamic factors to safety and to efficacy",0.1
"If there is any new insight in any of those that is unexpected, those are potentially fileable",-0.3
"
So what I’m excited to say is there are a broad range of potential reasons",0.6
What we are doing now is that we are working with our partners to see is the data supporting those and we will work closely with the partners to encourage them to get those patents filed,0.7
So I’m confident we will develop more co-formulation patents,1.0
We have none filed at this point in time,0.0

"First one is just on, up to $150 million of share repo plan for 2020",0.0
"I realize it’s early in the year, but why not get started on that sooner is question number one",0.0
"And then next one, just a simple modeling question",0.0
I know rHuPH20 supply sales can be sort of variable quarter-to-quarter,0.0
Anything we should be thinking about for Q1 and Q2 as it relates to just that quarterly cadence,-0.1
"
Helen Torley
Alright, we are getting started with the $150 million repurchase shortly Jess",0.1
"What we needed to do was finish the accelerated share repurchase program, which just finished in mid-February",0.7
And so that was the gate for us being able to start the next time share repurchase,0.0
"
With regard to the API, it is I know quite hard to model, because it does differ quarter-to-quarter",-1.0
"I think what we can say is, it is going to be lower this year than it was last year and you can see from our expenses, the range it was, and will probably be a bit more toward the second half of the year than the first half of the year, but we don’t as you know give quarter-by-quarter guidance, but hopefully that will be some just helpful direction for your modeling",0.0

Graig Suvannavejh
Hey, good afternoon",1.0
Thanks for taking my questions,1.0
Congrats on all the progress,1.0
"I think I’ve got two questions and maybe piggybacking on Jess’s question, but maybe more on the expense side of things",0.0
"In terms of that quarterly flow, and this may have been asked before, I might have missed it, but will that be relatively stable throughout the four quarters",-0.6
So that’s kind of my first question,0.0
"
And then perhaps on my second question, which has to do with the communication of new trial starts by partners",0.0
Is your current strategy really to provide those in these quarterly updates or do you envision that these might be separate stand-alone press releases,-1.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Helen Torley
Hi",0.0
Thanks Graig,1.0
"With regard to the expenses, you are going to see a decline quarter-on-quarter through the year until we hit that run rate that we’ve given of $65 million to $75 million by the fourth quarter",0.0
So that would be an annualized run rate of $65 million to $75 million in the fourth quarter,0.0
So you can triangulate from last year down to that as we’ve closed out our programs,0.0
"

And with regards to trial starts, it’s an interesting thing",0.2
"With our partners, often we’re finding, and this is an exciting change in how the partners are [Inaudible], these are competitive areas",1.0
"So wanting to start these studies for competitive differentiation, and they want to keep the information that they’re doing the study quiet and secret for as long as possible",0.8
"But I would say that generally, that you will get the first notice of a trial start if it’s in a patient population on clinicaltrials",0.0
gov,0.0
"It tends to be just before the study has started and once that is public in that setting, we’re able to talk about it",0.0
"
If it’s normal volunteer study, I will say that does not have to be posted",0.0
"For example, for a Phase I study, we may not be able to talk about that",0.0
"So to answer your question specifically, Graig, if there’s a milestone, we sometimes do a press release, but not always",0.0
We certainly will do a summary on our quarterly calls to let you know the seats-of-play for everything that’s happened in that quarter that we’re able to talk about,0.0

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Catanzaro with Piper Sandler",0.0
"
Joseph Catanzaro
Hey, thanks guys, thanks for taking the questions",1.0
Just two quick ones from me,0.0
"Maybe the first one on guidance as it relates to royalty revenues and your projections that they’ll decline modestly in 2020, does that consider any potential expected approvals in 2020 or does it just consider currently approved products",-0.1
"
And then my second question following up on the bispecific question asked earlier, more as it relates to the ENHANZE platform, does the ENHANZE platform have utility just with bispecific formats that have IGG, PK-like properties or does it extend across the broad spectrum of bispecific formats",0.0
Thanks,1.0
"
Helen Torley
Yeah",0.2
"On the first question Joe, we did – for the royalty revenues we have a modest decline of the continued impact on the Roche product and we have the beginning of royalty revenues starting with daratumumab",0.4
"At the time we did the projection, obviously we don’t know what the exact date of approval and we know that certain mechanical things happened in the first month after approval, but we do have a modest amount of sales in for daratumumab, but nothing for Perjeta-Herceptin",-0.2
"
And with regard to bispecific, I’ll have to get back to you on that",0.0
"I don’t know if I have the complete answer to that Joe, and I prefer to check in with our Chief Technical Officer and I will get back to you with the answer to that question",0.0

Your next question comes from the line of Joel Beatty with Citi",0.0
"
Joel Beatty
Hi, thanks for taking the questions",0.9
First one is about technology search,0.0
"Can you help give a sense of, it’s limited to maybe more narrowly to the technology that would improve upon ENHANZE as its approaching expiry, you know still several years away in 2027 or is the search kind of more broad about any type of technology that might be useful for your pharma partners",0.7
"
Helen Torley
Yeah, it is a broad search Joel, where we’re looking for a profile that from a financial perspective as we’ve discussed, is able to add to our revenue growth without having a strong impact on our overall picture",0.9
"And as we started the search there, that could be technology platform; it could be a new science that is also something we could license to companies",0.0
"
And so as we’ve begun looking, there is actually a wide array of things there",0.0
"But what we’re most focused on is having something with a similar profile to ENHANZE, where we can have a high-margin and high growth business that will benefit both our top line without having a lot of impact on the EPS profile",1.0
"

So still early days for us",0.1
"We are mostly focused on delivering on the ENHANZE promise near term, where we see a lot of near-term growth, but we are opportunistically beginning to look at finding the right type of platform to add",0.9
"
Joel Beatty
Great",1.0
Thanks,1.0
And then maybe one other question on ENHANZE in the 10 ongoing Phase I trials that are expected by the end of the year,0.0
Can you help give a sense of what a typical time line for those trials might be,0.9
"And then also you know if those Phase I trials are successful, where could that leave the agents",0.1
Would they go into maybe a smaller Phase II trial or could some of them go straight into pivotal trials,0.0
"
Helen Torley
Yeah, we’re seeing an evolution in the development program for ENHANZE and let me answer your first question first",0.1
"For Phase I, the fastest we’ve seen a company do a Phase I was actually Argenx who started their Phase I study in July and reported the data in December",0.8
"But I would say it’s a bit more normal for that to be about a year roughly long process for the companies to complete their Phase I study, so 12 months for that",0.0
"
If the company is bridging to an already approved product, they will go straight into Phase III program and do generally a non-inferiority study to demonstrate that PK parameter and efficacy are non-inferior between the subcu and the IV",-0.7
"If this is more of a novel development approach, where there is no large database to bridge to, the companies can do at Phase II",-0.4
"
And what we’re seeing more and more is they’re doing a seamless Phase II to Phase III as Argenx is talking about, where they have an initial part of the study, which is more Phase II, generating more efficacy and safety data at a specific dose and then expanding on a cohort to make that into a Phase III study",0.0
All of this obviously shortening the time lines as there aren’t causes between the different phases of the studies and also not causing to have to go and visit with the FDA for an end of Phase II meeting as an example,-0.2
"
So we’ve seen some very nice designs that are being sorted out and discussed with the FDA that are resulting in a much shorter timeline than we’ve traditionally seen",1.0
"To-date, the products have been approved have been five years from first in human to approval",0.0
"That’s quite a short period of time, but I think with the discussions that are happening today, we’re going to be able to knock one or even two years off that in the future",0.0
"
So very exciting changes happening, which I think is coming obviously from increased comfort with PH20 and the large safety databases we now have about the combination of our rHuPH20 with a range of different products",1.0
"
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Gena Wang with Barclays",0.0
"
Gena Wang
Thank you for taking my questions",1.0
Two regarding the 2020 guidance,0.0
The first one is royalty,0.1
"I think according to the slides Helen, you also mentioned the royalty would decline modestly",-0.1
"Does that mean the royalty will be lowered than $70 million, and how much daratumumab subcu contribution to this",0.3
are we talking about $5 million to $10 million,0.0
"
Helen Torley
Yeah, it will be we think modestly lower than the $70 million, which was the royalty revenues in 2019",0.0
"We haven’t given any specifics for daratumumab in terms of how much is there, but the factors to consider really are the timing of the approval and importantly for any U",0.1
S,-0.1
"launch, there is always a period of time where you want to be sure you’re getting your reimbursement in place, you’re on the electronic medical records and you’re on the formularies",0.0
"
And so with the mid-2020 approval, we actually see there will be just a few months of full access in sales, and we really see 2021 as being the year where we expect to see the exciting inflection point based on daratumumab uptake once all of that is in place",0.1
"So, we have a modest amount of sales in for 2020 in our projections",0.2
"

Gena Wang
So for 2021, daratumumab, you know what will be the assumption for the conversion for IV to subcu",0.0
"
Helen Torley
Yeah, we haven’t given that in detail",0.0
I know different people have provided that,0.0
"I mean when we think about the value proposition for patients, many patients require four to six hours for the IV",0.1
We’re going to be able to deliver in five minutes subcu,0.0
I think that’s a very strong value proposition,0.0
"
In addition, we know there is capacity constraints in the infusion suites, as well as nursing constraints, so we do think there will be an exciting uptake, but we’re not giving any specific numbers, but this is a very strong value proposition",-0.3
